# ECAID_Light – EC-AID  
*A Practical Scoring System for AI-Involved Creative Works*

---
## Summary

AI is now used in nearly every part of the creative process—from drafting, mixing, and mastering to idea generation, instrumentation, and formatting. But while usage is widespread, **the labeling is still binary and unnuanced**. Works are often tagged simply as “AI-Generated” or “Not AI,” which tells us little about **how** AI was used, **why** it was used, or **what role it played in authorship and intent**.

The EC-AID_Light framework introduces a practical solution. It offers a lightweight, two-part scoring system that splits evaluation between **observer perception** (EC) and **creator disclosure** (AID), using simple high/medium/low designations. This allows for more honest, flexible, and interpretable labeling—without requiring technical deep dives or forensic analysis.

EC-AID_Light doesn’t aim to prove or expose. It’s a way to **surface what matters**: how a work feels, what the creator intended, and whether the audience is given a fair chance to understand the role of AI in the final result.

## 1. Introduction

EC-AID_Light is a simplified version of the Ethical Creator Authorship and Intent Disclosure (ECAID) framework. It is designed to reduce friction in everyday use while still encouraging thoughtful evaluation of how AI contributes to creative work.

Rather than requiring a full audit across five axes, ECAID Light introduces a dual-track shorthand:  
- **EC** – scored by the *observer*  
- **AID** – scored by the *creator*  

Each measure is rated **High (2)**, **Medium (1)**, or **Low (0)**. These scores reflect how the work is perceived and how the creator frames its authorship, intent, and transparency.

---

## 2. Purpose and Use Cases

EC-AID_Light is intended for real-world, low-friction use—especially in environments where:
- Full audits are impractical
- Only partial information is available
- Lightweight transparency is more useful than heavy certification

It is designed for creators, curators, platforms, supervisors, and casual audiences who want a way to describe creative works that involve generative AI—*without requiring deep technical detail or exhaustive proof.*

## 3. Scoring Overview

### Format  
- **EC** = *Execution + Cultural Sensitivity* (scored by listener/observer)  
- **AID** = *Authenticity + Intention + Disclosure* (scored by the creator)

### Score Ranges  
- **EC** score: 0–4 (2 axes each with scores of 0 to 2)  
- **AID** score: 0–6 (2 axes each with scores of 0 to 2)

---

## 4. EC – Observer Scoring

### 4.1 Execution (E)  
**How convincingly the work feels human-made or skillfully realized**  
- **2 (High):** Expressive, natural, emotionally fluent  
- **1 (Medium):** Coherent but mechanical or repetitive  
- **0 (Low):** Awkward, implausible, clearly synthetic  

### 4.2 Cultural Sensitivity (C)  
**How respectfully and fluently the work engages with cultural styles**  
- **2 (High):** Deeply informed, appropriate, stylistically grounded  
- **1 (Medium):** Generic or borrowed but not offensive  
- **0 (Low):** Tone-deaf, exploitative, or contextually inappropriate  

**Total EC = E + C (range: 0–4)**

---

## 5. AID – Creator Scoring

### 5.1 Authenticity (A)  
**How personally meaningful, expressive, or intentional the work is**  
- **2 (High):** Authored with clear personal vision or story  
- **1 (Medium):** Loosely guided, exploratory, or remix-based  
- **0 (Low):** Fully procedural or disconnected from the creator  

### 5.2 Intention (I)  
**How deliberately AI was used in service of a creative goal**  
- **2 (High):** Strategically directed AI use to achieve artistic aims  
- **1 (Medium):** Used AI experimentally or opportunistically  
- **0 (Low):** AI used arbitrarily, without creative direction  

### 5.3 Disclosure (D)  
**Whether the creator makes AI involvement visible and understandable**  
- **2 (High):** Prominently disclosed at or near point of use  
- **1 (Medium):** Disclosed but hard to find or interpret  
- **0 (Low):** Undisclosed, vague, or intentionally hidden  

**Total AID = A + I + D (range: 0–6)**

## 6. Sample Interpretations

| EC | AID | Meaning                                                                 |
|----|-----|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 4  | 6   | Humanlike quality, strong authorship, full transparency                 |
| 3  | 4   | Polished and personal, but AI plays a supporting role                   |
| 2  | 2   | Moderate quality, partial authorship, minimal transparency              |
| 0  | 0   | Artificial output, no meaningful authorship or disclosure               |

These shorthand scores are designed to be legible even if only one side is visible. For example, streaming platforms may only display the creator's AID score; critics or reviewers may only report an EC score. The format is flexible enough to support either side individually or both together.

## 7. Strengths and Practical Applications

- **Low barrier to use:** No technical literacy or forensic detail required  
- **Clear authority split:** Prevents total self-certification  
- **Flexible implementation:** Works with metadata, publishing, reviews, or self-publishing  
- **Fosters honest labeling:** More nuanced than binary “AI vs Human” labels  

---

## 8. Limitations and Cautions

ECAID Light is not meant to:
- Certify originality or ownership  
- Detect AI involvement with forensic precision  
- Replace full ethical review or legal disclaimers  

It is best used as **a signal of creative framing and perceived quality**, not a final verdict. For works with high stakes (e.g. journalism, political media, or institutional messaging), full disclosure standards or more robust review systems are recommended.

## Appendix A: Reflections and Design Commentary

### Why High/Medium/Low Works  
Most people interact with creative work through gut feel.  
Does it *feel* real? Kind of real? Not at all?  
The three-tier system reflects that reality while avoiding academic complexity.

### EC3 and AID4 as a Practical Descriptor  
Scores like EC3 and AID4 signals:  
- The audience received the work as competent and credible  
- The creator views it as genuinely theirs, with honest acknowledgment of AI assistance  

You don’t need both scores to make sense of it. The format is frictionless by design.

### Gaming the System  
A creator could self-score AID as 6.  
But the **separation of scoring authority** ensures that only one side of the evaluation can be inflated.  
This alone reduces performative misuse.

### Approximation vs Trust  
The ternary system (high,medium,low) makes the scoring *feel approachable*.  
But it also risks appearing vague or too soft.  
This is a known limitation.

### Why Disclosure Lives in AID Only  
A fair criticism of EC-AID_Light is that **disclosure appears only on the authorial side (AID)**. In the full ECAID model, one might expect disclosure to be evaluated both as an action taken by the creator and as an experience perceived by the audience.

In the Light model, however, the choice is deliberate:  
- **Disclosure is treated as a creator-side responsibility**—the act of making AI involvement visible, whether or not it is seen or understood.  
- Whether the *audience feels duped* is not scored directly. Instead, this reaction is assumed to surface **practically and naturally** in how the listener rates *Execution* and *Cultural Sensitivity* (EC).

If the work feels hollow, deceptive, or inauthentic, it’s likely to show up as a low EC score—without requiring a separate disclosure axis.

The question of audience deception is important. But EC-AID_Light does **not attempt to measure the full communication loop**. That would require additional layers of evaluation and user feedback.

A future variant—such as **ECD-AID**—might explicitly separate:
- **D (authorial disclosure)** from  
- **D' (perceived transparency)**

...but that lies outside the streamlined scope of this model.
