# ECAID – Ethical Creator Authorship and Intent Disclosure

**ECAID** is a practical, interpretable framework for evaluating how generative AI is used in creative works.  
It moves beyond binary “AI-generated” labels and instead offers structured, multi-axis scores that reflect:

- How a work is likely to be **perceived** by others  
- How the creator **intended** and **disclosed** their use of AI

ECAID enables ethical transparency without requiring forensic analysis or total self-certification.

## 🔍 What Does It Do?

The framework defines **five core axes**:

1. **Execution** – How convincing, expressive, or polished the work appears  
2. **Cultural Sensitivity** – How fluently the work engages with cultural forms  
3. **Authenticity** – How personally meaningful or guided the work is  
4. **Intention** – How deliberately AI tools were used for expressive aims  
5. **Disclosure** – How clearly AI involvement was revealed to the audience

Each axis is scored from **0–10**, and visualized in a **radial chart** for quick interpretation.

ECAID supports:

- Artist self-disclosure  
- Third-party evaluations  
- Metadata tagging for platforms  
- Transparency in publishing and curation
