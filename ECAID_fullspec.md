# ECAID – Full Specification

*Ethical Creator Authorship and Intent Disclosure*

This document outlines the complete ECAID scoring system, including definitions, scoring criteria, examples, visual standards, and usage guidelines in one place for easy citation, implementation, and education.

---

### 🔷 ECAID Overview

**ECAID** stands for **Ethical Creator Authorship and Intent Disclosure**.  
It is a five-axis framework for scoring and communicating how AI was used—or not used—in creative work.

Each axis is scored on a 0–10 scale:

- **Execution** – How convincingly human the final work appears  
- **Cultural Sensitivity** – How respectfully it engages with traditions or identity  
- **Authenticity** – How much human authorship shaped the result  
- **Intention** – Why AI was used, and whether purpose aligns with outcome  
- **Disclosure** – How clearly AI use is communicated to audiences

Scores may be published as:

- Text (e.g. `7/8/6/9/10`)  
- Radar chart (with or without explanation)  
- Metadata tag or badge (Gold for self-assessed, Silver for third-party)

---

### 📋 Scoring Matrix (v1.0)

Each axis is defined and scored according to the [ECAID Checklist](#ecaid-checklist), a 5×10 rubric from scores 0 to 10.  
Scoring should be anchored in observable attributes and creator intent—not aesthetic preference.

Each axis is independent and non-hierarchical. No axis is more “important” than another.

---

### 🏅 Badge Structure

- **Gold Badge** – Scored by the artist or original creative team  
- **Silver Badge** – Estimated by third parties (reviewers, curators, platforms)  
- **Badges** are optional but encouraged for transparency and trust  
- **Visual resources** include `.svg` and `.png` formats and can be embedded in web, social, or cover assets

---

### 🧠 Underlying Philosophy

ECAID is based on the belief that:

- AI is already part of creative workflows  
- Binary classifications (AI vs. human) are too blunt  
- Disclosure builds trust  
- Authorship is shaped by process, not tools  
- Transparency doesn’t require apology

This framework supports creators who use AI thoughtfully—and those who avoid it—by offering a neutral, flexible structure for describing creative decisions.

---

### 🧩 Compatible Domains

ECAID is designed primarily for music, but is **applicable to**:

- Visual art  
- Writing and storytelling  
- Video and animation  
- Voice-based media  
- Interactive and procedural content

Domain-specific rubrics may be introduced in future versions, but the current framework is usable today with minimal adaptation.

---

### 🛠️ Implementation Guidelines

To implement ECAID in a release or catalog:

- Score the work using the Checklist and Axis Definitions  
- Include a short explanation or tags when publishing  
- Add scores to metadata, release copy, or platform descriptions  
- Display badges or radar charts for interpretability

Best practices for teams and labels are outlined in the [Implementation Guide](#ecaid-best-practices).

---

### 🗃️ Version and Change Tracking

ECAID follows a [semantic versioning model](#ecaid-governance):  
- Major = Structural change  
- Minor = Expanded examples, improved language  
- Patch = Typos or clarification

All versions remain publicly accessible for transparency and archival reference.

---

**ECAID is not a certification—it is a framework for context.**  
It invites ethical disclosure without prescribing aesthetic value or cultural judgment.

## <a name="ecaid-publishing"></a>Academic Proposal and Publishing Strategy

ECAID is designed not only as a practical tool for creators and curators, but also as a research-ready framework for scholars, critics, and educators interested in AI, authorship, and creative ethics.

This section outlines how ECAID can be positioned in academic, peer-reviewed, or institutional contexts—and how to cite or contribute to its continued development.

---

### 📚 Scholarly Relevance

ECAID contributes to ongoing conversations in:

- Digital humanities  
- Media studies  
- AI and ethics  
- Intellectual property  
- Creative industries research  
- Platform and metadata studies

It provides a formalized, multidimensional framework for **evaluating authorship and intent in AI-assisted works**, without reducing them to binaries.

---

### 🧪 Research Applications

Academic use cases for ECAID include:

- Studying how AI adoption varies across genre, region, or community  
- Analyzing disclosure patterns in public-facing metadata  
- Mapping trends in synthetic voice or instrumental usage  
- Investigating perceived authorship and emotional plausibility in generative media  
- Comparing creator self-scores with third-party estimations

The ECAID rubric can be incorporated into content audits, metadata classification systems, user studies, and critical analysis.

### Final Profile

**ECAID Score:**E [ __ ] / C [ __ ] / A [ __ ] / I [ __ ] / D [ __ ]  
(Execution / Cultural Sensitivity / Authenticity / Intention / Disclosure)

**ECAID Score:**  (Scores for E + C + A + I + D) * 2 to scale a aggregate score out of 100 and be presented at score/100.
Each dimension is scored from 1 to 10, based on the **highest-checked item** in the published list. No weighting is applied—scores are treated equally.



## <a name="ecaid-badge-standards"></a>Standards for Visualization of the ECAID Badge

The ECAID badge is a visual representation of a work’s five-axis score. It provides a fast, trustworthy signal of disclosure, authorship, and intent.

This document defines the visual standards for ECAID badge layout, color, formatting, and minimum display sizes across digital and physical platforms.

---

### 🧭 Badge Purpose

ECAID badges are not certifications or endorsements. They:

- Represent the five-axis score profile: Execution / Cultural Sensitivity / Authenticity / Intention / Disclosure

---

### 📎 Placement Guidelines

Badges may be embedded in:

- Track pages or descriptions  
- Liner notes and digital credits  
- Websites or press kits  
- Physical artwork or booklets  
- Social media graphics, playlist covers, or one-sheets

**Badges should always be legible, clearly labeled, and not treated as decorative.**

---

### 🧠 Optional Enhancements

Badges may include:

- Tooltip text or hover info on web  
- QR code linking to full score explanation  
- Creator comment or score breakdown  
- Verified badge version (coming soon)

These are encouraged but not required.

---

### 🧩 File Formats

- Preferred: `.svg` (for crisp scaling), `.png` (transparent background)  
- Alternate: `.jpg` or flattened image for constrained platforms  
- Should be exportable in dark/light variants

---

**Reminder:**  
The badge is a **signal of transparency**, not a status symbol. Its purpose is to support trust, not aesthetics alone.

## Visualizing the ECAID Score

ECAID scores can be displayed using multiple formats to make interpretation easier for audiences, curators, and collaborators. Each method highlights the balance and profile of AI use across the five ECAID axes:

- **Execution (E)**  
- **Cultural Sensitivity (C)**  
- **Authenticity (A)**  
- **Intention (I)**  
- **Disclosure (D)**

---

### Radar Chart (Pentagonal Map)

The **radar chart** is the primary visualization format for ECAID.

- The chart forms a regular pentagon.
- Each axis extends outward from the center and is scored from 0 (center) to 10 (outer edge).
- **Axis Order (Clockwise from 12 o’clock):**  
  Execution → Cultural Sensitivity → Authenticity → Intention → Disclosure
- The plotted shape shows the **relative ethical profile** of the work—highlighting strengths, gaps, and overall balance.



- A symmetrical, filled radar suggests balanced disclosure and intentionality.  
- An imbalanced radar may highlight underdeveloped or less transparent areas.  
- The **overall shape matters more than the total score**.

---

### Optional: Vertical Bar Chart

As a supplemental view, scores may also be displayed using a vertical bar chart:

- Each axis is shown as a vertical bar ranging from 0–10.
- Color coding can help interpret each ethical dimension.
- This format is ideal for mobile, accessibility, and text-based environments.

#### Example:

    Execution:            █████████▎  9  
    Cultural Sensitivity: ████████▍  8  
    Authenticity:         ███████▎   7  
    Intention:            ████████▊  8  
    Disclosure:           ████████▉  9

- Use bar charts for quick numeric scanning or dense metadata layouts.
- Use radar charts for intuitive reading and ethical shape profiling.

---

### Reading the Shape: Visual Score Analysis

Each ECAID chart tells a different story. Here’s how to interpret them:

| **Shape Type**         | **Interpretation**                                                                 |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Starburst (all high)   | Strong execution, thoughtful use, full disclosure. Transparent and intentional work. |
| Wedge (one low)        | Generally strong, but one weak axis suggests ethical or creative imbalance.          |
| Flat (all mid)         | Moderate use of AI with no clear strength or weakness. Consistent but unspectacular. |
| Spike (one high)       | High technical polish with low intentionality or disclosure. Possibly misleading.    |
| Hollow (all low)       | Likely fully synthetic or uncredited AI. Minimal ethical presence or transparency.   |

> **Tip:** Always include the numeric shorthand (e.g. `E/C/A/I/D = 9/8/7/8/9`) and badge type  
> (Gold for self-disclosed, Silver for third-party estimated) with visual displays.




### Reading ECAID as Shape Language

Each axis contributes to the ethical and interpretive *shape* of a creative work. Here’s how each dimension affects how the work is perceived, regardless of the total score:

---

#### Execution (E)
- **High E** gives the work credibility and surface polish. It passes as human-made, even when other dimensions are ethically weak. High-E work commands attention and often avoids scrutiny.
- **Low E** draws attention to artificiality. Weak execution exposes flaws in the rest of the ethical profile. Even with high scores elsewhere, Low E can undermine audience trust or emotional connection.

#### Cultural Sensitivity (C)
- **High C** signals care and fluency in navigating traditions or stylistic lineages. The work feels situated and informed—it acknowledges where its sounds or styles come from.
- **Low C** suggests ethical shortcuts. It may raise flags about appropriation, style mimicry without substance, or exploitative genre-hopping. Low C is often invisible to casual listeners but carries deep ethical weight in communities.

#### Authenticity (A)
- **High A** centers the creator’s voice. The work feels emotionally honest and personal, with a creative fingerprint that can’t be mistaken for AI or corporate pastiche.
- **Low A** feels detached. It may be technically strong or even culturally fluent, but it lacks the intimacy, story, or identity that gives music soul. Low A shapes perception around intent—raising questions about authorship, depth, and connection.

#### Intention (I)
- **High I** implies craft and clarity. AI use is purposeful, integrated into the creative process in a way that elevates the result. High I encourages respect even from skeptics.
- **Low I** reflects automation over authorship. It often signals opportunistic or careless use of tools without a clear creative vision—leading to hollow or derivative outcomes.

#### Disclosure (D)
- **High D** builds trust. It welcomes the audience into the process, reinforces consent in engagement, and shows confidence in the choices made.
- **Low D** can sour otherwise strong work. It introduces ambiguity or deception, especially if the work performs “humanness” convincingly. Low D paired with High E is especially ethically volatile.


## ECAID Archetypal Shapes

There are **32 archetypal shapes** for ECAID radar charts.  
Each represents a unique combination of **high (1)** and **low (0)** values across the five ECAID axes:

Each binary string (e.g., `10110`) defines a distinct profile shape based on whether each axis is high (1) or low (0).

### ECAID Binary Shape Index

Each cell represents one of the 32 archetypal ECAID profiles:  
`E C A I D` → `1` for High, `0` for Low

|       |       |       |       |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| 00111 | 01111 | 10111 | 11111 |
| 00101 | 01101 | 10101 | 11101 |
| 00011 | 01011 | 10011 | 11011 |
| 00001 | 01001 | 10001 | 11001 |
| 00110 | 01110 | 10110 | 11110 |
| 00100 | 01100 | 10100 | 11100 |
| 00010 | 01010 | 10010 | 11010 |
| 00000 | 01000 | 10000 | 11000 |

### Reference Visualization

Here is each of those possibilities visualized as a radar chart:

![ECAID Archetypal Shapes](ecaid_contact_sheet_grid_blue.png)

---

### Why These Shapes Matter

One of the best parts of the ECAID system is its **non-binary labeling** of each of the five dimensions.  
In actual use, scores can range from **0 to 10**, making the number of possible chart shapes practically infinite. (Technically, there are 10,000 possibilities)

But, understanding these **32 binary archetypes** is useful.  
They serve as **visual anchors**—the most exaggerated or extreme examples of a given profile—and can be used as reference points in conversation, documentation, or scoring discussions.

---

## ECAID Radar Chart Library

### 🧠 Chart Interpretations

| Code   | Interpretation |
|--------|----------------|
| 11111 | Fully realized work. High craft, clear authorship, cultural care, expressive intention, and transparent disclosure. Ethical gold standard. |
| 11110 | Nearly ideal work, but lacks transparency. Without disclosure, assumptions may distort perception. |
| 11011 | Strong form and cultural framing, with honest intent and disclosure—but lacks personal authorship. Feels crafted by committee. |
| 10111 | Polished and expressive, with clear authorship and disclosure, but lacking cultural depth. Feels stylized but floating. |
| 11101 | Slick and rooted, with clarity and craft—but intention feels generic or performative. Disclosure supports interpretation. |
| 01111 | Raw but sincere. Transparent about its origin, respectful of its influences, and rooted in a personal experience—but unpolished in form. |
| 01110 | Earnest and rooted in culture and intention, with clear authorship—but hidden methods. Risks misleading interpretation. |
| 11001 | Well-crafted and culturally fluent, but lacking identity or expressive motive. Disclosure helps mitigate ethical ambiguity. |
| 10011 | Stylish, declared, and expressive—but impersonal and culturally disengaged. A clean synthetic performance. |
| 10110 | Strong authorship and execution, intentionally expressive—but undisclosed. Raises questions despite emotional power. |
| 01011 | Feels respectful and transparent, with good intent, but has no personal voice or authorship. More curatorial than creative. |
| 01101 | More thoughtful in its references, with some care for influence—but still lacks deliberate structure or expressive aim. |
| 11100 | Slick and embedded in cultural understanding, with personal voice—but ambiguous in purpose and disclosure. |
| 10001 | High gloss and clean output, openly disclosed—but no deeper engagement. Feels commercially competent, ethically thin. |
| 00111 | A well-intentioned, transparent project with a personal voice, but minimal craft or cultural awareness. Feels honest, even if the execution is rough. |
| 11010 | Culturally aware and expressive, but missing authorship and disclosure. Could mislead or be appropriative. |
| 01010 | Feels like a tribute or cultural commentary. Honest in aim but distant in execution and origin. |
| 00110 | Emotionally sincere with personal authorship—but no transparency or cultural framing. Feels vulnerable, but murky. |
| 10101 | Well-produced with some author presence and disclosure, but feels automatic. Lacks clear emotional or cultural intent. |
| 01100 | Culturally attuned and authored, but lacking intention and clarity. May be interpreted in ways not aligned with its use. |
| 10100 | Clean production and personal authorship, but ethically foggy. Feels promotional or anonymous. |
| 00011 | Open and intentional, but entirely synthetic in form and authorship. A concept, not a voice. |
| 10010 | A polished emotional gesture with no authorship or disclosure. Feels manipulative without context. |
| 00101 | A rough, semi-transparent effort with some genuine voice—but little intention or context. Feels like a sketch made public. |
| 01001 | Appears to respect culture, but without authorship, execution, or expressive aim. Feels empty despite good references. |
| 00100 | Quietly personal but unclear in motive or origin. Feels like a found object—real but contextless. |
| 00010 | A conceptually expressive but structurally thin work. Feels like a prompt result with a hint of intention. |
| 00001 | Disclosed AI output with no meaningful direction or identity. A placeholder, not a statement. |
| 11000 | Well-made, culturally stylized—but with no expressive core or ethical anchoring. Looks real, feels hollow. |
| 10000 | A technically clean but decontextualized artifact. No voice, no disclosure, no roots. |
| 01000 | Culturally adjacent work without clarity, intention, authorship, or skill. Possibly imitative or accidental. |
| 00000 | Opaque, unskilled, unauthored, unintended, undisclosed. Functionally meaningless. |

## ECAID Use Case Examples

The ECAID framework is designed to describe a wide range of creative works involving artificial intelligence. Below are real-world inspired scenarios showing how ECAID can be applied to assess Execution, Cultural Sensitivity, Authenticity, Intention, and Disclosure.

Each case includes a proposed ECAID score and a brief rationale for each axis.

---

### 🎵 Case 1: 100% Human Song

### 🎛️ Case 2: AI-Augmented Hyperpop Track

**E/C/A/I/D = 9/7/8/9/10** → Total: **86** → 🟡 Gold

**Justification:**
- **Execution:** Highly polished and dynamic.

An AI-assisted work where the human creator retains authorship. Transparent, intentional, and culturally grounded.

### 🧬 Case 3: Remix Using AI-Generated Stems

**Description:**  
A remix producer creates a beat and uses AI-generated vocals imitating a famous voice. No permission is obtained, and no disclosure is made. The track is uploaded anonymously.

**Proposed Score:**  
**E/C/A/I/D = 7/3/2/5/0** → Total: **34** → ⚪ Silver

**Justification:**
- **Execution:** Technically smooth.
- **Cultural Sensitivity:** Ethically questionable voice mimicry.
- **Authenticity:** Borrowed voice, no personal authorship.
- **Intention:** Mostly stylistic, little expressive depth.
- **Disclosure:** None. Misleading to listener.

**Summary:**  
Polished but ethically risky. Use of synthetic voice without attribution or transparency erodes trust.

**Description:**  
A production company uses a text-to-music tool to generate lo-fi ambient tracks for YouTube and meditation apps. No artist is credited. No mention of AI is made.

**Proposed Score:**  
**E/C/A/I/D = 6/5/0/2/0** → Total: **26** → ⚪ Silver

**Justification:**
- **Execution:** Passable, functional background music.
- **Cultural Sensitivity:** Style-appropriate, but impersonal.
- **Authenticity:** No creative authorship; all generated.

- **Disclosure:** None; consumer unaware of AI origin.

**Summary:**  
A typical "invisible AI" case—undisclosed, uncredited, unexpressive. Not harmful in isolation, but lacks ethical grounding.
