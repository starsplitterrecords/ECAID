# ECAID  
**Ethical Creator Authorship and Intent Disclosure**

ECAID is a public standard for evaluating how AI is used in creative works. It gives artists, developers, and audiences a shared framework to understand and disclose AI involvement‚Äîwithout binary labels or misleading assumptions.
The current version of the standard is most application to music and music marketing, whether created with the use of generative or not.

## <a name="axes"></a>The Five Axes

**1. Execution**  
How convincingly does the work present itself as human-made? This axis reflects the likelihood that the work will be perceived as not involving AI, based on polish, nuance, timing, and expressive realism.

**2. Cultural Sensitivity**  
How was the work informed by or engaged with cultural context? This axis reflects the degree to which it honors, respects, or thoughtfully incorporates stylistic or cultural elements.

**3. Authenticity (Authorship)**  
How was the work initiated, directed, or shaped by a human creator? This considers the presence of meaningful human authorship or decision-making.

**4. Intention**  
How was AI used, and why? This axis explores the creator‚Äôs motivation‚Äîwhether experimental, expressive, practical, or commercial.

**5. Disclosure**  
How is the use of AI communicated to the audience? This considers clarity, transparency, and context across credits, metadata, and public messaging.

Each axis is scored 0‚Äì10. The scores are visualized in a radar chart, helping audiences interpret the context and ethics of AI-assisted work.

# <a name="foundation"></a>Foundational Guide: Understanding ECAID

## Introduction

ECAID (Ethical Creator Authorship and Intent Disclosure) is a flexible framework for evaluating and communicating how AI is used in the creation of artistic or expressive works. Rather than classifying works as either ‚ÄúAI‚Äù or ‚Äúnot AI,‚Äù ECAID offers a nuanced profile across five axes:

- **Execution**
- **Cultural Sensitivity**
- **Authenticity**
- **Intention**
- **Disclosure**

Each axis is scored from 0 to 10, with optional qualitative commentary or metadata tags. The result can be visualized using a radar chart, shared publicly, or used internally for audits, publishing, or curatorial purposes.

---

## Axis Breakdown

### 1. Execution

This measures how convincingly the final work could be perceived as human-made. It reflects polish, nuance, fluency, expressive detail, pacing, and emotional plausibility.

- **High scores (8‚Äì10)**: The work feels fully human-crafted to most observers.
- **Mid-range (4‚Äì7)**: The work has visible or audible machine signatures but is still expressive or skillfully rendered.
- **Low scores (0‚Äì3)**: The work is obviously or explicitly synthetic in feel, lacking subtlety or refinement.

### 2. Cultural Sensitivity

This measures whether the work respects the traditions, idioms, and sociocultural context of the styles or voices it draws from.

- **High scores**: The work shows awareness, care, and respectful engagement with source material.
- **Mid-range**: The work borrows stylistically without obvious harm or benefit.
- **Low scores**: The work caricatures, exploits, or erases cultural context.

### 3. Authenticity (Authorship)

This measures how meaningfully a human creator initiated, shaped, or directed the outcome.

- **High scores**: The work clearly reflects individual human choices, artistic development, or narrative intent.
- **Mid-range**: The human role was present but minimal, curated, or constrained.
- **Low scores**: The process was entirely delegated to AI with no meaningful authorship or creative curation.

### 4. Intention

This measures why AI was used‚Äîwhether for expression, efficiency, experimentation, profit, or novelty.

- **High scores**: AI is used with care, reflection, and artistic or expressive goals.
- **Mid-range**: AI is used out of convenience or technical experimentation.
- **Low scores**: AI is used purely to generate monetizable content or deceive.

### 5. Disclosure

This measures how clearly the use of AI is explained or acknowledged to the audience.

- **High scores**: The role of AI is explicitly disclosed in credits, metadata, or artist statements.
- **Mid-range**: Some signs are present but unclear or buried.
- **Low scores**: The use of AI is intentionally hidden or misrepresented.

---

## What ECAID Is Not

- ECAID is **not a scorecard for judging quality.** A work can be brilliant and still score low on authorship or disclosure.
- ECAID is **not a gatekeeper.** It does not assign legitimacy. It provides a transparent snapshot of process and ethics.
- ECAID is **not a certification or license.** It is a voluntary standard.

---

## Use Cases

- **Artists and Labels:** Add ECAID scores to your liner notes, credits, or metadata.
- **Curators and Publishers:** Use ECAID internally to evaluate submissions or signal transparency.
- **Educators and Researchers:** Use ECAID as a tool for discussion, media literacy, or analysis.
- **Audiences and Fans:** Use ECAID charts to better understand how work is made.

---

## Formats

ECAID scores can be shared:

- As a **numerical profile**
- As a **radar chart** (with optional captions)
- As **text commentary** in liner notes, site copy, or metadata

Example:

| Execution | Cultural Sensitivity | Authenticity | Intention | Disclosure |
|-----------|----------------------|--------------|-----------|------------|
|     8     |          9           |      6       |     7     |     10     |

This work was composed by a human using AI tools to assist with arrangement and vocal synthesis. The use of AI is fully disclosed. The work reflects thoughtful cultural engagement and clear creative direction, though much of the audio was rendered synthetically.

---

## Visual Style

ECAID charts should use a fixed axis order (clockwise from top):

1. Execution (12 o‚Äôclock)
2. Cultural Sensitivity
3. Authenticity
4. Intention
5. Disclosure

This layout is designed to suggest a narrative arc from surface to substance‚Äîwhat the work *looks like*, what it *draws from*, how it was *made*, *why*, and *how it's shared*.

---

## Summary

ECAID provides a practical, adaptable language for talking about the complexity of AI use in creative work. It helps distinguish intent from impact, performance from process, and authorship from automation‚Äîwithout shaming or glorifying either.

## <a name="ecaid-introduction"></a>Introduction to the ECAID Standard

**ECAID** (Ethical Creator Authorship and Intent Disclosure) is a flexible, five-axis framework for evaluating and disclosing the role of AI in the creation of expressive or artistic works. It offers a way to communicate how AI tools were used‚Äîhow much, how intentionally, and with what degree of transparency‚Äîwithout relying on binary labels like ‚ÄúAI-generated‚Äù or ‚Äúhuman-made.‚Äù

Instead of forcing a yes/no answer, ECAID profiles each work across five independent dimensions:

- **Execution** ‚Äì How convincingly human the final result appears  
- **Cultural Sensitivity** ‚Äì How the work interacts with cultural context and stylistic traditions  
- **Authenticity** ‚Äì How much meaningful authorship or creative control was exerted by a human  
- **Intention** ‚Äì Why AI was used and with what artistic or practical purpose  
- **Disclosure** ‚Äì How transparently AI use is communicated to the audience

Each axis is scored from 0‚Äì10. These scores can be visualized in a radar chart, used in metadata, referenced in liner notes, or applied internally as part of ethical review and transparency efforts.

ECAID is designed primarily for music and audio-based media, but the underlying structure is applicable to other creative domains including visual art, design, literature, and more.

---

### Who ECAID Is For

- **Artists and Producers** ‚Äì Who want to document and disclose their creative workflows  
- **Labels and Distributors** ‚Äì Who need consistent metadata for discovery and trust  
- **Curators and Editors** ‚Äì Who evaluate submissions across a wide range of creative approaches  
- **Audiences and Fans** ‚Äì Who are curious about the creative process and authorship  
- **Platforms and Developers** ‚Äì Who want clearer classification beyond ‚ÄúAI‚Äù vs ‚ÄúNot AI‚Äù  
- **Researchers and Critics** ‚Äì Who need a common language to explore authorship, automation, and ethics

ECAID provides nuance without judgment. It helps creators be transparent, audiences be informed, and communities have clearer conversations about how technology intersects with creativity.

---

### Why This Matters

AI tools are already embedded in modern creative workflows. But audiences often don‚Äôt know how, where, or why they‚Äôre used. ECAID helps make those choices visible‚Äîwhether the goal is trust, credit, discovery, or informed critique.

ECAID supports ethical transparency by:

- Encouraging thoughtful reflection and responsible use of AI
- Helping artists communicate their process without shame or hype
- Giving platforms and audiences better context for interpretation
- Laying groundwork for future standards, licensing, and recognition systems

This is a voluntary framework‚Äîmeant to foster openness, not impose judgment.
