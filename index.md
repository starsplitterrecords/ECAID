# ECAID  
**Ethical Creator Authorship and Intent Disclosure**

ECAID is a public standard for evaluating how AI is used in creative works. It gives artists, developers, and audiences a shared framework to understand and disclose AI involvement‚Äîwithout binary labels or misleading assumptions.

---

## <a name="axes"></a>The Five Axes

**1. Execution**  
How convincingly does the work present itself as human-made? This axis reflects the likelihood that the work will be perceived as not involving AI, based on polish, nuance, timing, and expressive realism.

**2. Cultural Sensitivity**  
How was the work informed by or engaged with cultural context? This axis reflects the degree to which it honors, respects, or thoughtfully incorporates stylistic or cultural elements.

**3. Authenticity (Authorship)**  
How was the work initiated, directed, or shaped by a human creator? This considers the presence of meaningful human authorship or decision-making.

**4. Intention**  
How was AI used, and why? This axis explores the creator‚Äôs motivation‚Äîwhether experimental, expressive, practical, or commercial.

**5. Disclosure**  
How is the use of AI communicated to the audience? This considers clarity, transparency, and context across credits, metadata, and public messaging.

Each axis is scored 0‚Äì10. The scores are visualized in a radar chart, helping audiences interpret the context and ethics of AI-assisted work.

Whether you're an artist, label, curator, educator, or platform, ECAID helps you map and explain the role of AI in a nuanced way. It‚Äôs not a pass/fail score‚Äîit‚Äôs a language for talking about process, ethics, and intention.

# <a name="foundation"></a>Foundational Guide: Understanding ECAID

## Introduction

ECAID (Ethical Creator Authorship and Intent Disclosure) is a flexible framework for evaluating and communicating how AI is used in the creation of artistic or expressive works. Rather than classifying works as either ‚ÄúAI‚Äù or ‚Äúnot AI,‚Äù ECAID offers a nuanced profile across five axes:

- **Execution**
- **Cultural Sensitivity**
- **Authenticity**
- **Intention**
- **Disclosure**

Each axis is scored from 0 to 10, with optional qualitative commentary or metadata tags. The result can be visualized using a radar chart, shared publicly, or used internally for audits, publishing, or curatorial purposes.

---

## Axis Breakdown

### 1. Execution

This measures how convincingly the final work could be perceived as human-made. It reflects polish, nuance, fluency, expressive detail, pacing, and emotional plausibility.

- **High scores (8‚Äì10)**: The work feels fully human-crafted to most observers.
- **Mid-range (4‚Äì7)**: The work has visible or audible machine signatures but is still expressive or skillfully rendered.
- **Low scores (0‚Äì3)**: The work is obviously or explicitly synthetic in feel, lacking subtlety or refinement.

### 2. Cultural Sensitivity

This measures whether the work respects the traditions, idioms, and sociocultural context of the styles or voices it draws from.

- **High scores**: The work shows awareness, care, and respectful engagement with source material.
- **Mid-range**: The work borrows stylistically without obvious harm or benefit.
- **Low scores**: The work caricatures, exploits, or erases cultural context.

### 3. Authenticity (Authorship)

This measures how meaningfully a human creator initiated, shaped, or directed the outcome.

- **High scores**: The work clearly reflects individual human choices, artistic development, or narrative intent.
- **Mid-range**: The human role was present but minimal, curated, or constrained.
- **Low scores**: The process was entirely delegated to AI with no meaningful authorship or creative curation.

### 4. Intention

This measures why AI was used‚Äîwhether for expression, efficiency, experimentation, profit, or novelty.

- **High scores**: AI is used with care, reflection, and artistic or expressive goals.
- **Mid-range**: AI is used out of convenience or technical experimentation.
- **Low scores**: AI is used purely to generate monetizable content or deceive.

### 5. Disclosure

This measures how clearly the use of AI is explained or acknowledged to the audience.

- **High scores**: The role of AI is explicitly disclosed in credits, metadata, or artist statements.
- **Mid-range**: Some signs are present but unclear or buried.
- **Low scores**: The use of AI is intentionally hidden or misrepresented.

## What ECAID Is Not

- ECAID is **not a scorecard for judging quality.** A work can be brilliant and still score low on authorship or disclosure.
- ECAID is **not a gatekeeper.** It does not assign legitimacy. It provides a transparent snapshot of process and ethics.
- ECAID is **not a certification or license.** It is a voluntary standard.

---

## Use Cases

- **Artists and Labels:** Add ECAID scores to your liner notes, credits, or metadata.
- **Curators and Publishers:** Use ECAID internally to evaluate submissions or signal transparency.
- **Educators and Researchers:** Use ECAID as a tool for discussion, media literacy, or analysis.
- **Audiences and Fans:** Use ECAID charts to better understand how work is made.

---

## Formats

ECAID scores can be shared:

- As a **numerical profile**
- As a **radar chart** (with optional captions)
- As **text commentary** in liner notes, site copy, or metadata

Example:

| Execution | Cultural Sensitivity | Authenticity | Intention | Disclosure |
|-----------|----------------------|--------------|-----------|------------|
|     8     |          9           |      6       |     7     |     10     |

This work was composed by a human using AI tools to assist with arrangement and vocal synthesis. The use of AI is fully disclosed. The work reflects thoughtful cultural engagement and clear creative direction, though much of the audio was rendered synthetically.

---

## Visual Style

ECAID charts should use a fixed axis order (clockwise from top):

1. Execution (12 o‚Äôclock)
2. Cultural Sensitivity
3. Authenticity
4. Intention
5. Disclosure

This layout is designed to suggest a narrative arc from surface to substance‚Äîwhat the work *looks like*, what it *draws from*, how it was *made*, *why*, and *how it's shared*.

---

## Summary

ECAID provides a practical, adaptable language for talking about the complexity of AI use in creative work. It helps distinguish intent from impact, performance from process, and authorship from automation‚Äîwithout shaming or glorifying either.
