# ECAID  
**Ethical Creator Authorship and Intent Disclosure**

ECAID is a public standard for evaluating, disclosing, and discussing how and why generative AI is (or isn't) used in creative works. It gives artists, developers, and audiences a shared framework to understand and disclose AI involvement‚Äîwithout binary labels or misleading assumptions.
The current version of the standard is most applicable to music and music marketing, created with any level of the use of generative or not.

---

## What Is ECAID?

**ECAID** stands for **Ethical Creator Authorship and Intent Disclosure**.  
It‚Äôs a simple, five-part framework for showing how AI was used (or not used) in the creation of a song.

Instead of dividing music into *AI vs human*, ECAID gives each piece its own unique profile across five axes:

- **Execution** ‚Äî How convincingly the final track sounds like a fully human-made work  
- **Cultural Sensitivity** ‚Äî How respectfully the work engages with specific styles, voices, or traditions  
- **Authenticity** ‚Äî How closely the work reflects the creator‚Äôs own style, message, or voice  
- **Intention** ‚Äî How thoughtfully AI was used during the creative process  
- **Disclosure** ‚Äî How openly the use of AI is shared with audiences  

Each axis is scored from 0‚Äì10 and can include short notes, tags, or context.  
These profiles can be shared, used for internal guidance, or shown visually as a **radar chart**.

**ECAID doesn‚Äôt judge if AI was used**‚Äîit helps explain *how* and *why*,  
so that creators, fans, and platforms can make more informed, intentional choices.

ECAID isn‚Äôt a rating or a rulebook. It‚Äôs a shared language.  
**Artists can self-assess, fans can explore, and curators can make better decisions.**  
It‚Äôs here to support ethical intent, creative control, and deeper understanding‚Äîwhatever your role.  

## Who is it for? 
Whether you're an artist, label, curator, educator, or platform, ECAID helps you map and explain the role of AI in a nuanced way. Since it‚Äôs not a pass/fail score‚Äîit‚Äôs a language for talking about process, ethics, and intention.

---

## Why ECAID?

### üéØ Clarity over hype  

AI is changing how we make music‚Äîbut conversations about it are often full of extremes.  
**ECAID offers a clear, grounded way to talk about how AI actually shows up in creative work**, beyond the buzzwords and fearmongering, while also acknowledging that work created using generative AI *can* have value to various stakeholders.

---

### ü•Ω Transparency without shame  

Creators deserve the freedom to experiment.  
Whether you're using AI for a single sound or to shape an entire track, **ECAID helps you explain your process without apology**‚Äîjust honesty, context, and confidence.

**Listeners deserve disclosure**‚Äîto avoid feeling duped after unknowingly becoming invested in something that was created with *any* level of AI generative input.

## <a name="foundation"></a>Foundational Guide: Understanding ECAID

   ### Introduction
   
   ECAID (Ethical Creator Authorship and Intent Disclosure) is a flexible framework for evaluating and communicating how AI is used in the creation of artistic or expressive works. Rather than classifying works as either ‚ÄúAI‚Äù or ‚Äúnot AI,‚Äù ECAID offers a nuanced profile across five axes:
   
   **The Five Axes**

   **1. Execution**  
      _How convincingly does the work present itself as human-made? This axis reflects the likelihood that the work will be perceived as not involving AI, based on polish, nuance, timing, and expressive realism._

   **2. Cultural Sensitivity**  
      _How was the work informed by or engaged with cultural context? This axis reflects the degree to which it honors, respects, or thoughtfully incorporates stylistic or cultural elements._
      
   **3. Authenticity (Authorship)**  
      _How was the work initiated, directed, or shaped by a human creator? This considers the presence of meaningful human authorship or decision-making._
   
   **4. Intention**  
      _How was AI used, and why? This axis explores the creator‚Äôs motivation‚Äîwhether experimental, expressive, practical, or commercial._

   **5. Disclosure**  
      _How is the use of AI communicated to the audience? This considers clarity, transparency, and context across credits, metadata, and public messaging._

   Each axis is scored from 0 to 10, with optional qualitative commentary or metadata tags. The result can be visualized using a radar chart, shared publicly, or used internally for audits, publishing, or curatorial purposes.

---

   ### What can the answers to these questions in each of these measures tell us?

   ### 1. Execution

   This measures how convincingly the final work could be perceived as human-made. It reflects polish, nuance, fluency, expressive detail, pacing, and emotional plausibility.

   - **High scores (8‚Äì10)**: The work feels fully human-crafted to most observers.
   - **Mid-range (4‚Äì7)**: The work has visible or audible machine signatures but is still expressive or skillfully rendered.
   - **Low scores (0‚Äì3)**: The work is obviously or explicitly synthetic in feel, lacking subtlety or refinement.

   ### 2. Cultural Sensitivity

   This measures whether the work respects the traditions, idioms, and sociocultural context of the styles or voices it draws from.

   - **High scores**: The work shows awareness, care, and respectful engagement with source material.
   - **Mid-range**: The work borrows stylistically without obvious harm or benefit.
   - **Low scores**: The work caricatures, exploits, or erases cultural context.

   ### 3. Authenticity (Authorship)

   This measures how meaningfully a human creator initiated, shaped, or directed the outcome.

   - **High scores**: The work clearly reflects individual human choices, artistic development, or narrative intent.
   - **Mid-range**: The human role was present but minimal, curated, or constrained.
   - **Low scores**: The process was entirely delegated to AI with no meaningful authorship or creative curation.

   ### 4. Intention

   This measures why AI was used‚Äîwhether for expression, efficiency, experimentation, profit, or novelty.

   - **High scores**: AI is used with care, reflection, and artistic or expressive goals.
   - **Mid-range**: AI is used out of convenience or technical experimentation.
   - **Low scores**: AI is used purely to generate monetizable content or deceive.

   ### 5. Disclosure

   This measures how clearly the use of AI is explained or acknowledged to the audience.

   - **High scores**: The role of AI is explicitly disclosed in credits, metadata, or artist statements.
   - **Mid-range**: Some signs are present but unclear or buried.
   - **Low scores**: The use of AI is intentionally hidden or misrepresented.

---

   ### What ECAID Is Not

   - ECAID is **not a scorecard for judging quality.** A work can be brilliant and still score low on authorship or disclosure.
   - ECAID is **not a gatekeeper.** It does not assign legitimacy. It provides a transparent snapshot of process and ethics.
   - ECAID is **not a certification or license.** It is a voluntary standard.
   - ECAID is **not a tool for evaluating generative content tools or platforms.** It is concerned only with the output of such tools and the derivative works developed after using such tools.


---

   ### Use Cases

   - **Artists and Labels:** Add ECAID scores to your liner notes, credits, or metadata.
   - **Curators and Publishers:** Use ECAID internally to evaluate submissions or signal transparency.
   - **Educators and Researchers:** Use ECAID as a tool for discussion, media literacy, or analysis.
   - **Audiences and Fans:** Use ECAID charts to better understand how work is made.


---

   ### Formats
   ECAID scores can either be **self disclosed OR 3rd party evaluated**. It is most effective as a disclosure tool, however it also provides a nuanced language for discussing others works.  
   ECAID scores are determined by finding the highest scored statements apply to each measure on to the standard checklist.  

   ECAID scores can be shared:
   - As a **numerical profile**
   - As a **radar chart** (with optional captions)
   - As **text commentary** in liner notes, site copy, or metadata

   Examples:

   | Execution | Cultural Sensitivity | Authenticity | Intention | Disclosure |
   |-----------|----------------------|--------------|-----------|------------|
   |     8     |          9           |      6       |     7     |     10     |

   This work was composed by a human using AI tools to assist with arrangement and vocal synthesis. The use of AI is fully disclosed. The work reflects thoughtful cultural engagement and clear creative direction, though much of the audio was rendered synthetically.

   ### Summary

   ECAID provides a practical, adaptable language for talking about the complexity of AI use in creative work. It helps distinguish intent from impact, performance from process, and authorship from automation‚Äîwithout shaming or glorifying either.





## <a name="ecaid-introduction"></a>Introduction to the ECAID Standard

**ECAID** (Ethical Creator Authorship and Intent Disclosure) is a flexible, five-axis framework for evaluating and disclosing the role of AI in the creation of expressive or artistic works. It offers a way to communicate how AI tools were used‚Äîhow much, how intentionally, and with what degree of transparency‚Äîwithout relying on binary labels like ‚ÄúAI-generated‚Äù or ‚Äúhuman-made.‚Äù

Instead of forcing a yes/no answer, ECAID profiles each work across five independent dimensions:

- **Execution** ‚Äì How convincingly human the final result appears  
- **Cultural Sensitivity** ‚Äì How the work interacts with cultural context and stylistic traditions  
- **Authenticity** ‚Äì How much meaningful authorship or creative control was exerted by a human  
- **Intention** ‚Äì Why AI was used and with what artistic or practical purpose  
- **Disclosure** ‚Äì How transparently AI use is communicated to the audience

Each axis is scored from 0‚Äì10. These scores can be visualized in a radar chart, used in metadata, referenced in liner notes, or applied internally as part of ethical review and transparency efforts.

ECAID is designed primarily for music and audio-based media, but the underlying structure is applicable to other creative domains including visual art, design, literature, and more.

---

### Who ECAID Is For

- **Artists and Producers** ‚Äì Who want to document and disclose their creative workflows  
- **Labels and Distributors** ‚Äì Who need consistent metadata for discovery and trust  
- **Curators and Editors** ‚Äì Who evaluate submissions across a wide range of creative approaches  
- **Audiences and Fans** ‚Äì Who are curious about the creative process and authorship  
- **Platforms and Developers** ‚Äì Who want clearer classification beyond ‚ÄúAI‚Äù vs ‚ÄúNot AI‚Äù  
- **Researchers and Critics** ‚Äì Who need a common language to explore authorship, automation, and ethics

ECAID provides nuance without judgment. It helps creators be transparent, audiences be informed, and communities have clearer conversations about how technology intersects with creativity.

---

### Why This Matters

AI tools are already embedded in modern creative workflows. But audiences often don‚Äôt know how, where, or why they‚Äôre used. ECAID helps make those choices visible‚Äîwhether the goal is trust, credit, discovery, or informed critique.

ECAID supports ethical transparency by:

- Encouraging thoughtful reflection and responsible use of AI
- Helping artists communicate their process without shame or hype
- Giving platforms and audiences better context for interpretation
- Laying groundwork for future standards, licensing, and recognition systems

This is a voluntary framework‚Äîmeant to foster openness, not impose judgment.

---

## <a name="ecaid-definitions"></a>Definitions and Scope of Each Axis

ECAID evaluates creative works using five independent axes. Each represents a different aspect of how AI is used, understood, or communicated in the creative process. Together, they form a multidimensional profile‚Äînot a grade, certification, or endorsement.

---

### 1. Execution  
**How convincingly human is the final work?**

This axis reflects the likelihood that an uninformed observer would perceive the work as being created by a human, without AI involvement. It includes polish, nuance, pacing, expressiveness, and stylistic fluency.

- High scores (8‚Äì10): The work feels deeply human, with emotional realism and expressive finesse.  
- Mid-range (4‚Äì7): The work has visible or audible machine qualities, but still demonstrates intent or artistry.  
- Low scores (0‚Äì3): The work is clearly synthetic, awkward, repetitive, or lacking expressive control.

Execution is not about whether the work is *good*‚Äîonly whether it convincingly *feels* like it came from a human process.

---

### 2. Cultural Sensitivity  
**How was the work informed by cultural context, and how respectfully does it engage with it?**

This axis evaluates whether the work meaningfully and thoughtfully interacts with the cultures, genres, idioms, or traditions it draws from. It‚Äôs not about genre alignment‚Äîit‚Äôs about relational awareness.

- High scores: The work shows respect, depth, and care in its references or borrowings.  
- Mid-range: The work uses familiar stylistic tropes without obvious harm or intention.  
- Low scores: The work caricatures, exploits, or erases the cultural source it draws from.

Cultural Sensitivity matters especially when AI is used to generate work in culturally distinct styles or with synthetic voices.

---

### 3. Authenticity (Authorship)  
**How meaningfully did a human creator initiate, guide, or shape the work?**

This axis focuses on authorship‚Äînot just who clicked the buttons, but who brought narrative, direction, or expressive decisions into the process.

- High scores: The work reflects human intent, development, editing, or emotional authorship.  
- Mid-range: A human was present in curation or oversight, but had limited creative control.  
- Low scores: The work was generated and selected by AI systems with minimal human shaping.

Authenticity helps distinguish between raw AI output and human-led works that use AI as a creative tool.

---

### 4. Intention  
**Why was AI used in the creation of this work?**

This axis evaluates the creator‚Äôs motivation‚Äîwhether artistic, exploratory, pragmatic, or commercial. It reflects creative values more than aesthetic traits.

- High scores: AI is used with purpose‚Äîaligned with the creator‚Äôs expressive or conceptual goals.  
- Mid-range: AI is used for experimentation or convenience, with neutral impact on meaning.  
- Low scores: AI is used opportunistically to generate high-volume, monetizable, or deceptive output.

Intention helps separate expressive use from exploitative use without moralizing. It invites transparency of motive.

---

### 5. Disclosure  
**How clearly is AI involvement communicated to the audience?**

This axis measures how openly the creator shares information about AI use‚Äîacross credits, metadata, public statements, or context.

- High scores: Disclosure is clear, prominent, and meaningfully framed.  
- Mid-range: Disclosure exists but may be ambiguous, inconsistent, or buried.  
- Low scores: AI use is intentionally hidden, minimized, or misrepresented.

Disclosure supports ethical transparency and informed reception. It enables audiences to understand the creative process, not guess at it.

---

These five axes can be scored independently from 0 to 10, then combined into a visual or written summary. Together, they form the core structure of ECAID.



## <a name="ecaid-checklist"></a>The ECAID Checklist (v1.0)

The ECAID Checklist provides a structured way to evaluate a creative work across the five ECAID axes. Each axis is scored on a 0‚Äì10 scale, using a descriptive rubric to anchor scoring decisions.

Use this checklist to:

- Self-assess your own work before release
- Estimate scores for public or peer works
- Guide disclosure and metadata practices
- Start ethical or curatorial conversations

---

### ECAID 5√ó10 Matrix

| Score | Execution | Cultural Sensitivity | Authenticity | Intention | Disclosure |
|-------|-----------|----------------------|--------------|-----------|------------|
| 10    | Indistinguishable from human-crafted in fluency, expression, pacing, and polish | Deeply respectful, contextually informed, and culturally grounded | Fully conceived, directed, and shaped by a human with expressive authorship | Strong artistic or conceptual purpose for AI use | Transparently disclosed and meaningfully contextualized |
| 9     | Seamless integration of AI tools into a convincing artistic result | Thoughtful engagement with traditions and styles, informed by research or lived experience | Human vision is clearly present in both form and message | Clear alignment between intent and execution | Disclosure is clear and accessible in multiple forms |
| 8     | Professionally produced with minor AI artifacts detectable only under scrutiny | Generally respectful with minor issues or stylistic assumptions | Mostly human-led with some automation or guided generation | Used for aesthetic exploration or technical constraint | Explicitly disclosed once, such as in metadata or credits |
| 7     | Polished but emotionally flatter or less dynamic than human standard | Stylistically accurate but with limited cultural depth | Human role present in editing or curation | Used for workflow convenience or to complete partial ideas | Disclosure available but not emphasized or explained |
| 6     | Competent but repetitive, overfit, or stylistically generic | Uses familiar tropes without clear engagement or harm | Co-authored with AI, with unclear creative direction | Used pragmatically with mixed goals | Partially disclosed (e.g. tagged as ‚ÄúAI‚Äù) without clarity |
| 5     | Adequate execution with some clumsy or uncanny elements | Surface-level imitation without awareness or reflection | Human role mostly in prompting or selection | Used experimentally or without strong direction | Disclosure is vague, suggested, or inconsistently applied |
| 4     | Clearly machine-generated with awkward phrasing or errors | Borrowed from culture without understanding or nuance | Minimal curation; bulk AI generation | Used for novelty or fast production | Only mentioned if asked, or hard to find |
| 3     | Disjointed, synthetic, or obviously templated in rhythm and tone | Feels derivative or appropriative without acknowledgment | Little to no human shaping or storytelling | Used for SEO, bait, or passive monetization | Disclosure avoided or euphemized |
| 2     | Feels empty, mechanical, or algorithmic with no expressive depth | Cultural content repackaged with no insight or care | Fully delegated to AI systems, randomly or at scale | Used purely to imitate trends or maximize output | Disclosure only visible through metadata or external tools |
| 1     | Transparently auto-generated without editing or nuance | Exploitative or mocking use of cultural signifiers | No authorship present‚Äîpure algorithmic churn | No creative purpose; purely volume-driven | Disclosure actively suppressed, misleading, or false |
| 0     | Failed output or nonfunctional content | Offensive or destructive use of cultural material | Entirely unauthored, copied, or spammed | Used to mislead, deceive, or impersonate | Intentionally hidden, falsely credited, or deceptively marketed |

---

### How to Use This Checklist

- **Each axis is scored separately.** There is no average or total score.
- **Use the rubric, not your instincts.** Anchor your scores in the descriptions above.
- **Explain your scores if publishing them.** Include short commentary or tags where possible.

This checklist may evolve over time with community input and pilot use. Version 1.0 is optimized for use in music and adjacent creative fields.

## <a name="ecaid-visualization"></a>Badge and Scoring Visualization Guidelines

ECAID scores can be displayed publicly using simple visual formats that convey transparency, not judgment. These visualizations help audiences understand how AI was involved‚Äîwithout requiring them to read technical details.

---

### üî∑ Radar Chart (Recommended)

The most effective ECAID visualization is a five-axis **radar chart** (also known as a spider graph), where each axis represents one of the five ECAID categories:

- Execution  
- Cultural Sensitivity  
- Authenticity  
- Intention  
- Disclosure  

Each score (0‚Äì10) plots outward from the center. The more filled-in the chart, the more deliberate, human-guided, and transparent the use of AI tends to be.

**Example:**  
Execution: 8  
Cultural Sensitivity: 7  
Authenticity: 6  
Intention: 9  
Disclosure: 10  

This would appear as a lopsided pentagon, heavily weighted toward disclosure and artistic purpose.

---

### üèÖ Gold vs Silver Badges

ECAID badge color is determined by **who assigns the scores**:

- **Gold Badge** ‚Äî The score was **self-disclosed by the creator or artist**, and includes a short written explanation, comment, or metadata note.  
- **Silver Badge** ‚Äî The score was **estimated or assigned by a third party**, such as a curator, platform, reviewer, or academic study.  

This distinction preserves transparency while avoiding gatekeeping. Both badges represent valid use of the framework.

---

### üìù Suggested Metadata Format

For liner notes, credits, or streaming metadata, include:

- **ECAID Profile** (e.g. `8/7/6/9/10`)  
- **Scored by:** Artist / Label / Listener / Reviewer  
- **Link to full chart** (if hosted)  
- **Short comment** (optional)  

**Example:**  
`ECAID: 8/7/6/9/10 (Scored by artist) ‚Äì AI-assisted arrangement and synthetic vocals. Fully disclosed.`

---

### üîó Visual Badge Download (Coming Soon)

The ECAID project will provide downloadable `.svg` badge templates for:

- Gold and Silver variants  
- Light and dark backgrounds  
- Embed-ready snippets for Bandcamp, websites, PDFs, etc.

In the meantime, creators may create their own chart visuals, or use inline text and table formats to represent scores.

---

**Reminder:** ECAID badges and charts are not certifications or endorsements.  
They are **transparency tools**‚Äîmeant to open up conversation and support more informed interpretation of creative work.

## <a name="ecaid-self-assessment"></a>Guidelines for Self-Assessment

ECAID was designed for creators to score and disclose their own work. This section provides clear, ethical, and flexible guidance for artists, producers, and creative teams who want to apply the framework to their projects.

Self-assessment is not about perfection‚Äîit‚Äôs about clarity, ownership, and honest communication.

---

### ‚úçÔ∏è How to Self-Assess Using ECAID

1. **Familiarize Yourself with the Axes**  
   Read the [Definitions and Scope](#ecaid-definitions) for each of the five axes:  
   Execution, Cultural Sensitivity, Authenticity, Intention, and Disclosure.

2. **Reflect on the Creative Process**  
   Ask:
   - What role did AI play‚Äîif any?
   - Where did I make key decisions?
   - Why did I choose to use AI (or not)?
   - Who or what did I draw inspiration from?
   - How did I disclose my process to others?

3. **Score Each Axis (0‚Äì10)**  
   Use the [ECAID Checklist](#ecaid-checklist) to assign scores based on your honest understanding of your process. Don‚Äôt aim for perfect 10s‚Äîaim for accuracy.

4. **Add Notes or Tags (Optional but Encouraged)**  
   Brief comments help others interpret your scores. Examples:
   - ‚ÄúSynth vocal generated from human-written lyrics.‚Äù
   - ‚ÄúAI-generated baseline, edited and restructured by artist.‚Äù
   - ‚ÄúInspired by Afrobeat but collaborated with cultural experts.‚Äù

5. **Publish or Embed Your Profile**  
   Include your scores:
   - In credits or liner notes
   - On your Bandcamp, SoundCloud, Audius, or DSP pages
   - As part of a visual badge or radar chart
   - In metadata or album notes

---

### üè∑Ô∏è Tone and Framing

Your ECAID self-assessment should be:

- **Neutral** ‚Äì Avoid moralizing your use of AI. This is not a confession.  
- **Specific** ‚Äì Focus on your creative process, not vague statements like "AI-assisted."  
- **Confident** ‚Äì Your use of tools is valid. Be clear and direct about your choices.

---

### üö´ Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Guessing your score** without referring to the rubric  
- **Overstating human authorship** to appear more ‚Äúauthentic‚Äù  
- **Downplaying or omitting disclosure** to avoid judgment  
- **Using ECAID as a marketing gimmick** rather than a reflection of process

---

### üß≠ Why Self-Assessment Matters

Self-assessment with ECAID builds trust and transparency‚Äîespecially as AI tools become more widespread and invisible.  
When creators lead the way in disclosure, audiences are more likely to engage, respect, and support the work.

You‚Äôre not claiming purity. You‚Äôre showing process.

## <a name="ecaid-third-party"></a>Guidelines for Third-Party Estimation

ECAID can also be used by listeners, curators, critics, reviewers, and researchers to estimate how AI was used in a creative work‚Äîeven if the original creator has not provided a score.

This is not about exposing or accusing. Third-party estimation helps surface patterns, support transparency, and build trust when disclosure is absent or incomplete.

---

### üß™ When to Estimate

You might choose to estimate ECAID scores when:

- Reviewing or writing about a release  
- Curating a playlist or exhibition  
- Analyzing trends in media, genre, or authorship  
- Studying AI‚Äôs impact on the creative economy  
- Interpreting a work with ambiguous or missing disclosure  

---

### üß∞ How to Estimate Responsibly

1. **Use Publicly Observable Evidence**  
   Only evaluate what‚Äôs available: the final work, metadata, interviews, credits, social media, or artist statements. Do not speculate beyond what you can reasonably infer.

2. **Stay Grounded in the Rubric**  
   Refer to the [Checklist](#ecaid-checklist) and [Axis Definitions](#ecaid-definitions) for consistent interpretation. Score each axis separately. Avoid averaging or generalizing.

3. **Label the Score as Third-Party**  
   Clearly distinguish estimated scores from creator-provided scores. Use the **silver badge** (not gold) and include context or uncertainty where needed.

4. **Add Short Comments (Optional but Helpful)**  
   Examples:
   - ‚ÄúLyrics human-written; vocals likely synthetic based on tone and phrasing.‚Äù  
   - ‚ÄúNo disclosure found; visual style matches known AI art templates.‚Äù  
   - ‚ÄúAppears culturally referential, but context unclear.‚Äù

5. **Avoid Harmful Framing**  
   Don‚Äôt use ECAID scores to shame, call out, or undermine artists. Instead, frame the estimation as a tool for understanding process‚Äînot policing it.

---

### ü§ù Use Cases for Estimation

- **Curators** may use third-party scores to maintain metadata consistency across mixed disclosures.  
- **Reviewers** may cite ECAID to provide ethical context or highlight transparent artistry.  
- **Researchers** may use scoring to analyze AI adoption trends across regions, genres, or formats.  
- **Educators** may assign estimation as part of critical media literacy.

---

### üö® Limitations and Responsibilities

Third-party scoring:

- **Cannot reveal intent**‚Äîonly creators know their motivation.  
- **May contain bias** based on assumptions or lack of context.  
- **Should be open to revision** if more information becomes available.  
- **Should never imply endorsement or penalty** based on score.

Use this tool to **foster transparency, not judgment**‚Äîespecially in the absence of clear disclosure.

## <a name="ecaid-ethics"></a>Public Disclosure and Ethics in the Absence of Regulation

ECAID is a voluntary framework. There are no current laws requiring creators to disclose how AI was used in their work. That‚Äôs exactly why public disclosure matters.

In a world where regulation lags behind technology, **voluntary ethics are leadership**.

---

### ü§î Why Disclose at All?

Because audiences care‚Äîeven when they don‚Äôt know what to ask.  
Because trust is earned‚Äînot assumed.  
Because what seems optional now may become foundational later.

When creators disclose honestly and proactively, they:

- Build lasting trust with listeners and fans  
- Reduce confusion, suspicion, or backlash  
- Lead by example in emerging digital ethics  
- Contribute to a healthier, more transparent creative ecosystem

---

### üß© Disclosure Without Rules

In the absence of mandates, creators, curators, and platforms have to decide:

- What counts as AI use worth disclosing?  
- How much detail is appropriate?  
- How do we avoid overreacting‚Äîor underreacting‚Äîto automation?

ECAID provides language and structure to answer these questions consistently.

---

### ‚öñÔ∏è Ethics Over Compliance

The question isn‚Äôt ‚ÄúWhat am I required to say?‚Äù  
The question is ‚ÄúWhat would I want to know, if I were on the other side of this?‚Äù

Ethical disclosure means:

- Sharing enough to give others an informed view  
- Framing AI use honestly, not defensively or evasively  
- Avoiding false impressions about human authorship or effort  
- Respecting your audience‚Äôs right to make their own judgments

---

### üß† The Invisible Problem

The more AI blends into the creative process, the harder it is for audiences to detect.  
Even artists may forget where the boundary was.  
That‚Äôs why intentional documentation and proactive transparency are essential‚Äîeven when no one is forcing it.

---

### üå± Setting Norms for the Future

Regulation will come. So will clearer licensing, royalty attribution, and platform policies.

But right now, what we do‚Äîor fail to do‚Äîsets the tone for how culture handles this transition.

By using ECAID, creators and platforms aren‚Äôt just protecting themselves.  
**They‚Äôre shaping the future of disclosure culture.**

## <a name="ecaid-marketing"></a>Use of ECAID in Music Marketing and Discovery

ECAID isn‚Äôt just a tool for ethics‚Äîit‚Äôs a tool for visibility.  
By clearly disclosing how AI was used (or not used), creators can strengthen audience trust, increase playlist opportunities, and stand out in a crowded, algorithmically filtered landscape.

---

### üì¢ Marketing with Clarity

Transparent metadata helps fans and curators make informed choices. It also helps creators tell a better story.

ECAID scores can be used in:

- Press releases or artist bios  
- DSP metadata and liner notes  
- YouTube and Bandcamp descriptions  
- TikTok and Instagram captions  
- Playlist pitches and one-sheets

By providing a **clear narrative of authorship and intention**, artists give curators and listeners a reason to care‚Äîand a framework to connect.

---

### üîç Algorithmic Discovery

AI-generated music is everywhere‚Äîbut most algorithms can‚Äôt distinguish thoughtful artistry from spam. ECAID gives platforms a signal.

Use ECAID scoring to:

- Tag high-quality synthetic works with human authorship  
- Separate experimental pieces from deceptive output  
- Identify culturally sensitive or intentionally crafted content  
- Enable new kinds of filters or playlists for hybrid or AI-assisted music

As discovery tools evolve, **ECAID offers a way to surface intentionality**‚Äînot just genre or popularity.

---

### üí° Artist Positioning

ECAID can help artists:

- Signal care and creative control  
- Acknowledge synthetic tools without defensiveness  
- Engage with AI-curious or AI-cautious audiences alike  
- Differentiate from fully automated or low-effort content

Whether you're fully human-made or AI-integrated, **the transparency itself becomes part of your brand.**

---

### ü§ù Industry and Label Use

For labels, collectives, or sync agencies, ECAID profiles can:

- Help assess catalog quality and creative source  
- Guide pitching strategy to editorial teams or supervisors  
- Support compliance with future disclosure guidelines  
- Provide structured data for contracts, licenses, or negotiations

ECAID becomes not just an ethical signal‚Äîbut a **competitive advantage** in metadata-rich environments.

---

### üìà From Niche to Norm

As the music world adapts to AI, ECAID lets artists lead the conversation instead of reacting to it.

**Early adopters set expectations.  
Transparent creators build loyalty.  
Clarity outlasts trend cycles.**



## <a name="ecaid-templates"></a>ECAID Use Disclosure Templates

Clear disclosure helps your audience understand how AI was used in your creative process.  
These ready-to-use templates make it easy to include ECAID scores and context in bios, metadata, credits, or captions‚Äîwherever your work is shared.

You can adapt them for tone, platform, or space constraints. The goal is always the same: **honest, transparent communication that respects your audience.**

---

### üéµ Streaming Metadata / Credits

**Example 1:**  
**ECAID:** 7/8/6/9/10  
Scored by artist ‚Äì Human-written song, arranged with AI-assisted harmonies and synthetic vocals. Fully disclosed and culturally informed.

- **Defensive** (not recommended): ‚ÄúThis wasn‚Äôt made by a robot.‚Äù  
- **Confident:** ‚ÄúI use the best tools available‚ÄîAI included.‚Äù

---

**Reminder:**  
You don‚Äôt need to overexplain‚Äîjust be honest, consistent, and clear.  
Disclosure should feel normal, not like a warning.


## <a name="ecaid-synthetic-performance"></a>Handling Synthetic Performance and AI Tools

The line between human and machine is increasingly blurred‚Äîespecially in performance.

When vocals, instruments, and expressions are generated synthetically, it raises new questions about authorship, emotional intent, and credit. ECAID helps creators and audiences navigate these blurred boundaries without needing to resolve them entirely.

---

### üó£Ô∏è What Is Synthetic Performance?

Synthetic performance includes:

- AI-generated vocals or instruments (e.g. Vocaloid, voice clones, sample-based drum kits)
- Real-time AI improvisation or algorithmic playing
- Text-to-music or prompt-based generation (e.g. ‚Äúmake a sad ambient piano loop‚Äù)
- Deepfake-style recreations of human performance

Synthetic performance is not the same as bad performance‚Äîor even fake performance. It‚Äôs a **new form of expressive mediation**, and how it‚Äôs used matters.

---

### ü§ñ Human-Like ‚â† Human-Led

A track may sound incredibly expressive‚Äîeven emotional‚Äîbut that doesn‚Äôt mean it was authored by a human.

ECAID‚Äôs **Execution** axis asks:  
‚ÄúHow convincingly does this sound human?‚Äù

But **Authenticity** and **Intention** ask:  
‚ÄúWho shaped this?‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù

This difference is crucial. A highly emotional performance could be 100% synthetic‚Äîwhat matters is whether that was intentional, transparent, and ethically situated.

---

### üéöÔ∏è Human-Machine Collaboration

Many modern tracks include:

- Human-written lyrics, AI-sung  
- Human voice, AI-enhanced  
- AI-generated stems, human-curated  
- Human instruments, AI-arranged

Rather than trying to classify work as ‚ÄúAI‚Äù or ‚Äúnot AI,‚Äù ECAID scores let creators document the blend. **How much control was exerted? How much was disclosed?**

---

### üß† Ethical Questions to Consider

- Was this performance borrowed from a real person?  
- Did the synthetic voice mimic a cultural or regional accent?  
- Would the audience reasonably assume this was a human?  
- Has the creator disclosed enough to prevent confusion?

These questions don‚Äôt have binary answers‚Äîbut ECAID provides a space to surface and reflect on them.

---

### üéØ Focus on Process, Not Purity

Synthetic performance doesn‚Äôt disqualify a work from being creative, personal, or powerful. But its use **does warrant transparency**‚Äîespecially when emotion and identity are involved.

ECAID helps shift the conversation from ‚ÄúIs this real?‚Äù to:

- ‚ÄúWhat choices were made?‚Äù  
- ‚ÄúHow was AI used?‚Äù  
- ‚ÄúWhat should the audience know?‚Äù

## <a name="ecaid-axis-relationships"></a>Relationship Between Authenticity, Intention, and Disclosure

While each ECAID axis stands alone, three of them‚Äî**Authenticity**, **Intention**, and **Disclosure**‚Äîoften interact in meaningful and sometimes subtle ways.

Together, they form the heart of how audiences interpret **ethics**, **authorship**, and **trust**.

---

### üß≠ The Triangle of Perception

- **Authenticity** asks: *Was this truly shaped by a human creator?*  
- **Intention** asks: *Why was AI used‚Äîwhat was the purpose?*  
- **Disclosure** asks: *How clearly is the use of AI communicated to others?*

These dimensions are deeply intertwined. High performance in one can **amplify or offset** perceptions in another.

---

### üé≠ When Authenticity Feels Missing

If a work is:

- Beautifully rendered  
- Disclosed as AI-generated  
- But lacks evidence of human voice, values, or perspective‚Ä¶

...it may still leave audiences feeling disconnected‚Äîeven if disclosure was perfect.

This is where **Intention** becomes essential. Why was the work made? Was it expressive, exploratory, or just procedural?

---

### üß† The Intention‚ÄìDisclosure Tradeoff

Creators who use AI for **non-artistic** purposes (e.g. rapid production, trend mimicry) may still score fairly‚Äî**if** they are open and honest about it.

Likewise, a deeply human-guided work that fails to disclose its AI elements risks being seen as deceptive or opportunistic.

This tension is where ECAID excels: it doesn‚Äôt punish any single path, but rewards transparency and alignment.

---

### üí° Examples of Interplay

**Scenario A:**  
A track uses AI vocals to express human-written lyrics about grief.  
- High authenticity  
- High intention  
- High disclosure  
This may resonate as powerful and ethically clear.

**Scenario B:**  
A mood playlist filler track generated using prompt-based tools, with no explanation.  
- Low authenticity  
- Low intention  
- Low disclosure  
This might feel hollow or manipulative, even if it sounds polished.

**Scenario C:**  
An AI cover of a folk song, tagged clearly as synthetic and used in an experimental art piece.  
- Low authenticity  
- Medium‚Äìhigh intention  
- High disclosure  
This could still be artistically valid and ethically solid.

---

### üéØ Why This Matters

Audiences are not just asking: *‚ÄúWas AI used?‚Äù*  
They‚Äôre asking: *‚ÄúDo I trust this artist?‚Äù*, *‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the purpose of this work?‚Äù*, and *‚ÄúAm I being misled?‚Äù*

Authenticity, Intention, and Disclosure form the **ethical core** of the ECAID profile‚Äîand when they align, the result is not just transparency, but **credibility**.

## <a name="ecaid-cultural-framework"></a>Framework for Cultural Sensitivity vs Appropriation

As AI makes it easier to mimic, sample, or generate content in styles drawn from cultures other than one‚Äôs own, the stakes around **representation**, **appropriation**, and **respect** increase.

ECAID‚Äôs **Cultural Sensitivity** axis exists to help creators and curators navigate this terrain with intention and care‚Äîespecially when genres, instruments, vocal styles, or languages are culturally specific.

This is not a purity test. It‚Äôs a lens for thoughtful engagement.

---

### üåç What Counts as Culturally Sensitive?

A work shows cultural sensitivity when it:

- Demonstrates awareness of the origin and meaning of the styles it draws from  
- Engages with the cultural context‚Äînot just the aesthetics  
- Credits collaborators, references, or traditions where relevant  
- Avoids caricature, pastiche, or superficial imitation  
- Welcomes feedback from communities whose voices are echoed

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è What Might Count as Appropriation?

Appropriation may be present when a work:

- Mimics or exploits the sound of a culture without understanding or acknowledgment  
- Uses accents, dialects, or vocal models in a way that feels cartoonish or extracted  
- Applies AI tools to generate culturally specific content without care or credit  
- Benefits from traditions it doesn‚Äôt belong to‚Äîwhile those within the culture are marginalized

Intent matters‚Äîbut so does **impact**.

---

### üß™ Cultural Sensitivity in AI Contexts

AI complicates cultural borrowing in new ways:

- Text prompts make it easy to ask for a "reggaeton beat," "K-pop voice," or "Indian tabla loop"‚Äîwith no context.  
- Voice cloning lets anyone mimic regional styles or historical figures.  
- Language models may hallucinate inaccurate or offensive translations of cultural phrases.  
- AI may flatten diverse traditions into aesthetic presets with no roots.

ECAID doesn‚Äôt forbid these tools‚Äîbut it asks:  
**Did the creator think about what they were using‚Äîand why?**

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Practical Ways to Score Cultural Sensitivity

High scores on this axis typically reflect:

- Collaboration with artists from referenced cultures  
- Inclusion of commentary or context in release notes  
- Use of AI tools in a way that honors rather than exploits  
- Willingness to revise based on feedback or critique  
- Careful editing to avoid stereotypes or superficial stylization

Low scores reflect careless or extractive use, even if unintentional.

---

### üéØ Summary

Cultural Sensitivity is about **relationship**, not restriction.  
ECAID helps ask:  
- ‚ÄúWhose voice is this?‚Äù  
- ‚ÄúWhere did this come from?‚Äù  
- ‚ÄúWhat responsibility comes with using it?‚Äù

These aren‚Äôt questions to avoid‚Äîthey‚Äôre questions worth leaning into.

## <a name="ecaid-non-music"></a>Application to Non-Music Creative Domains

Although ECAID was initially designed with music in mind, its five-axis structure is adaptable to other creative domains‚Äîincluding **visual art**, **writing**, **film**, **design**, and **interactive media**.

The core principles‚Äîtransparency, authorship, intent, cultural awareness, and execution‚Äîapply across mediums. What changes is the **form of expression**, not the **ethical framework**.

---

### üé® Visual Art

ECAID can be used to evaluate:

- Prompt-based AI-generated images  
- AI-assisted photo editing or design work  
- Style transfer or visual mimicry  
- Culturally specific styles, symbols, or aesthetics

Creators can self-assess:

- Whether the composition was arranged or purely generated  
- Whether human editing shaped the final image  
- Whether cultural references were thoughtfully integrated  
- Whether AI use was disclosed in the description, metadata, or title

---

### ‚úçÔ∏è Writing and Literature

ECAID works for:

- AI-assisted fiction, poetry, or essays  
- Machine-generated outlines, dialogue, or prompts  
- Collaborative drafting tools like predictive text or co-writing systems

In these cases:

- **Execution** considers fluency, pacing, and emotional tone  
- **Authenticity** reflects how much the human author revised or shaped the text  
- **Intention** and **Disclosure** matter when works are marketed as personal or literary

---

### üé• Film and Video

In media involving motion or voice:

- ECAID can apply to synthetic voiceovers, deepfake actors, or AI-generated b-roll  
- Scores reflect who directed the narrative, how visuals were assembled, and whether disclosure occurs in credits or platform metadata

ECAID is especially useful when AI is used for **storytelling**, not just tooling.

---

### üéÆ Games and Interactive Media

ECAID may be adapted to analyze:

- Procedural content generation (worlds, quests, NPC dialogue)  
- AI-driven storytelling systems  
- Synthetic voices or motion capture stand-ins  
- Genre emulation in interactive music or environments

Games often blend authorship and algorithm. ECAID clarifies which parts were **crafted**, which were **generated**, and what the **creative intent** was.

---

### üß™ Adaptation Notes

While the **axes remain the same**, some scoring guidelines may need context-specific nuance. For example:

- ‚ÄúExecution‚Äù in music might mean polish and realism; in visual art, it could mean composition, depth, or anatomy  
- ‚ÄúCultural Sensitivity‚Äù in fiction may include how characters and dialogue are written, not just style  
- ‚ÄúDisclosure‚Äù could be handled via credits, site copy, or interactive UI messaging

Future versions of ECAID may include **domain-specific rubrics**, but the current framework is already usable beyond music‚Äîwith thoughtful application.

---

**ECAID is not medium-locked.**  
It is a structure for ethical authorship and creative transparency‚Äîwherever and however creativity takes form.

## <a name="ecaid-best-practices"></a>Implementation Best Practices for Artists and Labels

Adopting ECAID at the artist or label level means building a culture of transparency, not just checking a box.

Whether you release one track a year or manage hundreds across multiple artists, these best practices can help make ECAID a consistent and trusted part of your creative and publishing process.

---

### üß± Start with Internal Alignment

Before you publish ECAID scores:

- Discuss what each axis means to your team or artist roster  
- Review recent projects and how AI tools were (or weren‚Äôt) used  
- Decide how you want to frame disclosure‚Äînarratively, factually, or both  
- Choose whether self-assessment will be done by artists, producers, or marketing teams

A shared understanding builds consistency across releases.

---

### üìä Standardize ECAID Across Metadata

Apply ECAID scores consistently to:

- Streaming platform metadata  
- Digital liner notes or PDFs  
- Website releases  
- Submission portals or promo sheets  
- Label databases and archives

Keep a master record of all ECAID scores per release for reference.

---

### üß© Make Disclosure Part of the Process

Integrate ECAID into:

- Your release checklists  
- Internal project review cycles  
- Artist onboarding or training  
- Contract templates for featured artists or collaborators

This reduces friction and ensures everyone knows when and how to score a work.

---

### üñºÔ∏è Visual Consistency

Use consistent badge graphics, radar charts, or disclosure phrases across all public releases.

Options include:

- Gold badges for self-assessed scores  
- Silver badges for third-party estimation (if used internally or externally)  
- Short narrative summaries for fans or curators

Clarity breeds credibility.

---

### üéôÔ∏è Encourage Artist Ownership

Let artists write or approve their own ECAID disclosures whenever possible.  
Give them examples, templates, and room for nuance.  
The goal isn‚Äôt compliance‚Äîit‚Äôs **voice**.

---

### üîÅ Revisit Scores Over Time

Some creators evolve. Some disclosures need refinement.  
Revisit old releases periodically to:

- Add missing context  
- Correct assumptions  
- Update disclosures to reflect current standards

Transparency is a living practice‚Äînot a one-time task.

---

### üß† Summary

- Normalize scoring as part of the creative and release workflow  
- Build documentation around disclosure and metadata  
- Use ECAID as a storytelling tool, not just a rating  
- Treat it as a cultural signal of quality, thoughtfulness, and accountability

**Labels that embrace ECAID set themselves apart‚Äînot just ethically, but strategically.**

## <a name="ecaid-licensing"></a>Badge Licensing and Distribution Model

ECAID badges‚Äîvisual representations of a work‚Äôs score profile‚Äîare designed for **open use**, but may also be distributed in standardized or premium formats depending on context.

Badges help signal that a work has been thoughtfully scored using the ECAID framework. They are not certifications, endorsements, or quality ratings‚Äîthey‚Äôre just clarity, made visual.

---

### üèÖ Badge Types

There are two main badge types based on who scored the work:

- **Gold Badge** ‚Äì Self-assessed by the artist, label, or original creative team  
- **Silver Badge** ‚Äì Estimated by a third party such as a curator, critic, or platform

Both badge types can be displayed publicly, shared in metadata, or embedded in cover art, visuals, or credits.

---

### üì¶ Standard Badge Assets (Free)

The following badge resources will be available for public use:

- `.svg` and `.png` formats in light/dark themes  
- Horizontal and stacked layouts  
- Icon-only and labeled variants  
- Downloadable badge packs from the ECAID website

These can be added to:

- Bandcamp headers or descriptions  
- DSP metadata  
- YouTube video frames or overlays  
- EPKs, social posts, or visualizers  
- Cover art or inner packaging

No license is needed to use these basic badges with your own score.

---

### üé® Custom Badge Generation (Optional)

To support adoption and consistency, the ECAID project may offer:

- An official badge generator (web-based)  
- Embeddable chart widgets  
- Verified artist/label attribution  
- Score validation against rubric

These services would remain optional and would not gate access to the framework.

---

### üíº Commercial Use & Publishing Contexts

Labels, agencies, and distributors integrating ECAID badges into their **publications, promo, or packaging** may:

- Use standard badge kits freely with attribution  
- Request brand-compliant or resized versions  
- Commission custom variants (e.g., co-branded or multi-track badges)

Please credit the ECAID standard when used in commercial releases:

### üîê Future Verification Services (Optional)

As ECAID adoption grows, the project may introduce:

- Score claim validation (against the rubric)  
- Artist profile linking / reputation signals  
- Licensing for verified badge use in high-visibility campaigns or sync  
- Platform-level integrations with DSPs or metadata aggregators

None of these will be required. The core ECAID framework and badges will always remain open.

---

**ECAID badges are a language of disclosure‚Äînot a gate to access.**  
Whether self-made or auto-generated, they help make AI authorship visible in the creative ecosystem.

## <a name="ecaid-governance"></a>Governance, Change Management, and Versioning

ECAID is designed to evolve. As creative technologies, cultural norms, and industry needs change, the framework will require thoughtful updates.

- **Q4 (October‚ÄìDecember)** ‚Äì Outreach, education, and integration support

---

### üß† Community-Driven Input

ECAID is not owned by a single company or platform.  
It‚Äôs an open standard stewarded by a volunteer editorial group and supported by contributions from artists, researchers, curators, and technologists.

Anyone can:

- Propose updates or additions to the rubric  
- Suggest improvements to axis definitions  
- Submit real-world examples or case studies

- **Neutrality** ‚Äì Does it maintain flexibility across genres and tools?  
- **Practicality** ‚Äì Can the change be implemented by creators without high overhead?  
- **Alignment** ‚Äì Does it preserve ECAID‚Äôs purpose: clarity, transparency, and authorship insight?

Final decisions are made by a governance circle composed of representatives from different creative domains.

---

### üóÇÔ∏è Archive and Legacy Use

All prior versions of the ECAID standard will remain:

- Publicly accessible  
- Clearly dated and versioned  
- Available for citation or historic reference

Legacy scores remain valid and may continue to use the badge format from the version in effect at the time of release.

---

**ECAID is a living standard.**  
Its strength comes from adaptation‚Äîguided by shared values, not rigid control.

## <a name="ecaid-full-spec"></a>Full ECAID Standard Reference Document

This section serves as the complete technical and philosophical reference for the ECAID framework as of version 1.0.  
It consolidates all axes, definitions, rubrics, scoring methods, use cases, and ethical framing into one place for easy citation, implementation, and education.

---

### üî∑ ECAID Overview

**ECAID** stands for **Ethical Creator Authorship and Intent Disclosure**.  
It is a five-axis framework for scoring and communicating how AI was used‚Äîor not used‚Äîin creative work.

Each axis is scored on a 0‚Äì10 scale:

- **Execution** ‚Äì How convincingly human the final work appears  
- **Cultural Sensitivity** ‚Äì How respectfully it engages with traditions or identity  
- **Authenticity** ‚Äì How much human authorship shaped the result  
- **Intention** ‚Äì Why AI was used, and whether purpose aligns with outcome  
- **Disclosure** ‚Äì How clearly AI use is communicated to audiences

Scores may be published as:

- Text (e.g. `7/8/6/9/10`)  
- Radar chart (with or without explanation)  
- Metadata tag or badge (Gold for self-assessed, Silver for third-party)

---

### üìã Scoring Matrix (v1.0)

Each axis is defined and scored according to the [ECAID Checklist](#ecaid-checklist), a 5√ó10 rubric from scores 0 to 10.  
Scoring should be anchored in observable attributes and creator intent‚Äînot aesthetic preference.

Each axis is independent and non-hierarchical. No axis is more ‚Äúimportant‚Äù than another.

---

### üèÖ Badge Structure

- **Gold Badge** ‚Äì Scored by the artist or original creative team  
- **Silver Badge** ‚Äì Estimated by third parties (reviewers, curators, platforms)  
- **Badges** are optional but encouraged for transparency and trust  
- **Visual resources** include `.svg` and `.png` formats and can be embedded in web, social, or cover assets

---

### üß† Underlying Philosophy

ECAID is based on the belief that:

- AI is already part of creative workflows  
- Binary classifications (AI vs. human) are too blunt  
- Disclosure builds trust  
- Authorship is shaped by process, not tools  
- Transparency doesn‚Äôt require apology

This framework supports creators who use AI thoughtfully‚Äîand those who avoid it‚Äîby offering a neutral, flexible structure for describing creative decisions.

---

### üß© Compatible Domains

ECAID is designed primarily for music, but is **applicable to**:

- Visual art  
- Writing and storytelling  
- Video and animation  
- Voice-based media  
- Interactive and procedural content

Domain-specific rubrics may be introduced in future versions, but the current framework is usable today with minimal adaptation.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Guidelines

To implement ECAID in a release or catalog:

- Score the work using the Checklist and Axis Definitions  
- Include a short explanation or tags when publishing  
- Add scores to metadata, release copy, or platform descriptions  
- Display badges or radar charts for interpretability

Best practices for teams and labels are outlined in the [Implementation Guide](#ecaid-best-practices).

---

### üóÉÔ∏è Version and Change Tracking

ECAID follows a [semantic versioning model](#ecaid-governance):  
- Major = Structural change  
- Minor = Expanded examples, improved language  
- Patch = Typos or clarification

All versions remain publicly accessible for transparency and archival reference.

---

**ECAID is not a certification‚Äîit is a framework for context.**  
It invites ethical disclosure without prescribing aesthetic value or cultural judgment.

## <a name="ecaid-publishing"></a>Academic Proposal and Publishing Strategy

ECAID is designed not only as a practical tool for creators and curators, but also as a research-ready framework for scholars, critics, and educators interested in AI, authorship, and creative ethics.

This section outlines how ECAID can be positioned in academic, peer-reviewed, or institutional contexts‚Äîand how to cite or contribute to its continued development.

---

### üìö Scholarly Relevance

ECAID contributes to ongoing conversations in:

- Digital humanities  
- Media studies  
- AI and ethics  
- Intellectual property  
- Creative industries research  
- Platform and metadata studies

It provides a formalized, multidimensional framework for **evaluating authorship and intent in AI-assisted works**, without reducing them to binaries.

---

---

### üß© File Formats

- Preferred: `.svg` (for crisp scaling), `.png` (transparent background)  
- Alternate: `.jpg` or flattened image for constrained platforms  
- Should be exportable in dark/light variants

---

**Reminder:**  
The badge is a **signal of transparency**, not a status symbol. Its purpose is to support trust, not aesthetics alone.

## Visualizing the ECAID Score

ECAID scores can be displayed using multiple formats to make interpretation easier for audiences, curators, and collaborators. Each method highlights the balance and profile of AI use across the five ECAID axes:

- **Execution (E)**  
- **Cultural Sensitivity (C)**  
- **Authenticity (A)**  
- **Intention (I)**  
- **Disclosure (D)**

---

### Radar Chart (Pentagonal Map)

The **radar chart** is the primary visualization format for ECAID.

- The chart forms a regular pentagon.
- Each axis extends outward from the center and is scored from 0 (center) to 10 (outer edge).
- **Axis Order (Clockwise from 12 o‚Äôclock):**  
  Execution ‚Üí Cultural Sensitivity ‚Üí Authenticity ‚Üí Intention ‚Üí Disclosure
- The plotted shape shows the **relative ethical profile** of the work‚Äîhighlighting strengths, gaps, and overall balance.



- A symmetrical, filled radar suggests balanced disclosure and intentionality.  
- An imbalanced radar may highlight underdeveloped or less transparent areas.  
- The **overall shape matters more than the total score**.

---

### Optional: Vertical Bar Chart

As a supplemental view, scores may also be displayed using a vertical bar chart:

- Each axis is shown as a vertical bar ranging from 0‚Äì10.
- Color coding can help interpret each ethical dimension.
- This format is ideal for mobile, accessibility, and text-based environments.

#### Example:

    Execution:            ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñé  9  
    Cultural Sensitivity: ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñç  8  
    Authenticity:         ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñé   7  
    Intention:            ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñä  8  
    Disclosure:           ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñâ  9

- Use bar charts for quick numeric scanning or dense metadata layouts.
- Use radar charts for intuitive reading and ethical shape profiling.

---

### Reading the Shape: Visual Score Analysis

Each ECAID chart tells a different story. Here‚Äôs how to interpret them:

| **Shape Type**         | **Interpretation**                                                                 |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Starburst (all high)   | Strong execution, thoughtful use, full disclosure. Transparent and intentional work. |
| Wedge (one low)        | Generally strong, but one weak axis suggests ethical or creative imbalance.          |
| Flat (all mid)         | Moderate use of AI with no clear strength or weakness. Consistent but unspectacular. |
| Spike (one high)       | High technical polish with low intentionality or disclosure. Possibly misleading.    |
| Hollow (all low)       | Likely fully synthetic or uncredited AI. Minimal ethical presence or transparency.   |

> **Tip:** Always include the numeric shorthand (e.g. `E/C/A/I/D = 9/8/7/8/9`) and badge type  
> (Gold for self-disclosed, Silver for third-party estimated) with visual displays.




### Reading ECAID as Shape Language

Each axis contributes to the ethical and interpretive *shape* of a creative work. Here‚Äôs how each dimension affects how the work is perceived, regardless of the total score:

---

#### Execution (E)
- **High E** gives the work credibility and surface polish. It passes as human-made, even when other dimensions are ethically weak. High-E work commands attention and often avoids scrutiny.
- **Low E** draws attention to artificiality. Weak execution exposes flaws in the rest of the ethical profile. Even with high scores elsewhere, Low E can undermine audience trust or emotional connection.

#### Cultural Sensitivity (C)
- **High C** signals care and fluency in navigating traditions or stylistic lineages. The work feels situated and informed‚Äîit acknowledges where its sounds or styles come from.
- **Low C** suggests ethical shortcuts. It may raise flags about appropriation, style mimicry without substance, or exploitative genre-hopping. Low C is often invisible to casual listeners but carries deep ethical weight in communities.

#### Authenticity (A)
- **High A** centers the creator‚Äôs voice. The work feels emotionally honest and personal, with a creative fingerprint that can‚Äôt be mistaken for AI or corporate pastiche.
- **Low A** feels detached. It may be technically strong or even culturally fluent, but it lacks the intimacy, story, or identity that gives music soul. Low A shapes perception around intent‚Äîraising questions about authorship, depth, and connection.

#### Intention (I)
- **High I** implies craft and clarity. AI use is purposeful, integrated into the creative process in a way that elevates the result. High I encourages respect even from skeptics.
- **Low I** reflects automation over authorship. It often signals opportunistic or careless use of tools without a clear creative vision‚Äîleading to hollow or derivative outcomes.

#### Disclosure (D)
- **High D** builds trust. It welcomes the audience into the process, reinforces consent in engagement, and shows confidence in the choices made.
- **Low D** can sour otherwise strong work. It introduces ambiguity or deception, especially if the work performs ‚Äúhumanness‚Äù convincingly. Low D paired with High E is especially ethically volatile.


## ECAID Archetypal Shapes

There are **32 archetypal shapes** for ECAID radar charts.  
Each represents a unique combination of **high (1)** and **low (0)** values across the five ECAID axes:

Each binary string (e.g., `10110`) defines a distinct profile shape based on whether each axis is high (1) or low (0).

### ECAID Binary Shape Index

Each cell represents one of the 32 archetypal ECAID profiles:  
`E C A I D` ‚Üí `1` for High, `0` for Low

|       |       |       |       |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| 00111 | 01111 | 10111 | 11111 |
| 00101 | 01101 | 10101 | 11101 |
| 00011 | 01011 | 10011 | 11011 |
| 00001 | 01001 | 10001 | 11001 |
| 00110 | 01110 | 10110 | 11110 |
| 00100 | 01100 | 10100 | 11100 |
| 00010 | 01010 | 10010 | 11010 |
| 00000 | 01000 | 10000 | 11000 |

### Reference Visualization

Here is each of those possibilities visualized as a radar chart:

![ECAID Archetypal Shapes](ecaid_contact_sheet_grid_blue.png)

---

### Why These Shapes Matter

One of the best parts of the ECAID system is its **non-binary labeling** of each of the five dimensions.  
In actual use, scores can range from **0 to 10**, making the number of possible chart shapes practically infinite. (Technically, there are 10,000 possibilities)

But, understanding these **32 binary archetypes** is useful.  
They serve as **visual anchors**‚Äîthe most exaggerated or extreme examples of a given profile‚Äîand can be used as reference points in conversation, documentation, or scoring discussions.

### üß† Chart Interpretations

| Code   | Interpretation |
|--------|----------------|
| 11111 | Fully realized work. High craft, clear authorship, cultural care, expressive intention, and transparent disclosure. Ethical gold standard. |
| 11110 | Nearly ideal work, but lacks transparency. Without disclosure, assumptions may distort perception. |
| 11011 | Strong form and cultural framing, with honest intent and disclosure‚Äîbut lacks personal authorship. Feels crafted by committee. |
| 10111 | Polished and expressive, with clear authorship and disclosure, but lacking cultural depth. Feels stylized but floating. |
| 11101 | Slick and rooted, with clarity and craft‚Äîbut intention feels generic or performative. Disclosure supports interpretation. |
| 01111 | Raw but sincere. Transparent about its origin, respectful of its influences, and rooted in a personal experience‚Äîbut unpolished in form. |
| 01110 | Earnest and rooted in culture and intention, with clear authorship‚Äîbut hidden methods. Risks misleading interpretation. |
| 11001 | Well-crafted and culturally fluent, but lacking identity or expressive motive. Disclosure helps mitigate ethical ambiguity. |
| 10011 | Stylish, declared, and expressive‚Äîbut impersonal and culturally disengaged. A clean synthetic performance. |
| 10110 | Strong authorship and execution, intentionally expressive‚Äîbut undisclosed. Raises questions despite emotional power. |
| 01011 | Feels respectful and transparent, with good intent, but has no personal voice or authorship. More curatorial than creative. |
| 01101 | More thoughtful in its references, with some care for influence‚Äîbut still lacks deliberate structure or expressive aim. |
| 11100 | Slick and embedded in cultural understanding, with personal voice‚Äîbut ambiguous in purpose and disclosure. |
| 10001 | High gloss and clean output, openly disclosed‚Äîbut no deeper engagement. Feels commercially competent, ethically thin. |
| 00111 | A well-intentioned, transparent project with a personal voice, but minimal craft or cultural awareness. Feels honest, even if the execution is rough. |
| 11010 | Culturally aware and expressive, but missing authorship and disclosure. Could mislead or be appropriative. |
| 01010 | Feels like a tribute or cultural commentary. Honest in aim but distant in execution and origin. |
| 00110 | Emotionally sincere with personal authorship‚Äîbut no transparency or cultural framing. Feels vulnerable, but murky. |
| 10101 | Well-produced with some author presence and disclosure, but feels automatic. Lacks clear emotional or cultural intent. |
| 01100 | Culturally attuned and authored, but lacking intention and clarity. May be interpreted in ways not aligned with its use. |
| 10100 | Clean production and personal authorship, but ethically foggy. Feels promotional or anonymous. |
| 00011 | Open and intentional, but entirely synthetic in form and authorship. A concept, not a voice. |
| 10010 | A polished emotional gesture with no authorship or disclosure. Feels manipulative without context. |
| 00101 | A rough, semi-transparent effort with some genuine voice‚Äîbut little intention or context. Feels like a sketch made public. |
| 01001 | Appears to respect culture, but without authorship, execution, or expressive aim. Feels empty despite good references. |
| 00100 | Quietly personal but unclear in motive or origin. Feels like a found object‚Äîreal but contextless. |
| 00010 | A conceptually expressive but structurally thin work. Feels like a prompt result with a hint of intention. |
| 00001 | Disclosed AI output with no meaningful direction or identity. A placeholder, not a statement. |
| 11000 | Well-made, culturally stylized‚Äîbut with no expressive core or ethical anchoring. Looks real, feels hollow. |
| 10000 | A technically clean but decontextualized artifact. No voice, no disclosure, no roots. |
| 01000 | Culturally adjacent work without clarity, intention, authorship, or skill. Possibly imitative or accidental. |
| 00000 | Opaque, unskilled, unauthored, unintended, undisclosed. Functionally meaningless. |

## ECAID Use Case Examples

The ECAID framework is designed to describe a wide range of creative works involving artificial intelligence. Below are real-world inspired scenarios showing how ECAID can be applied to assess Execution, Cultural Sensitivity, Authenticity, Intention, and Disclosure.

Each case includes a proposed ECAID score and a brief rationale for each axis.

---

### üéµ Case 1: 100% Human Song

**Description:**  
An acoustic folk song written, performed, recorded, and produced by a human artist with no AI assistance. Lyrics are personal and original, production is modest but effective. No mention of AI is made because none is used.

**Proposed Score:**  
**E/C/A/I/D = 8/8/10/10/10** ‚Üí Total: **92** ‚Üí üü° Gold

**Justification:**
- **Execution:** Musically competent and emotionally resonant.
- **Cultural Sensitivity:** Rooted in appropriate tradition (folk).
- **Authenticity:** Original lyrics and performance.
- **Intention:** Clearly personal and expressive.
- **Disclosure:** No AI use = implicitly complete.

**Summary:**  
A fully human, self-made work of clear expressive intent. While not flashy, it embodies craft and authorship in a direct, ethical way.

---

### üéõÔ∏è Case 2: AI-Augmented Hyperpop Track

**Description:**  
A hyperpop producer writes lyrics, uses a synthetic voice (trained on public datasets), and employs AI to generate harmony layers and beat textures. The artist discloses this fully in the track notes and social media.

**Proposed Score:**  
**E/C/A/I/D = 9/7/8/9/10** ‚Üí Total: **86** ‚Üí üü° Gold

**Justification:**
- **Execution:** Highly polished and dynamic.
- **Cultural Sensitivity:** Synth voice resembles mainstream styles; use is appropriate and respectful.
- **Authenticity:** Lyrics and arrangement are artist-originated.
- **Intention:** Strong expressive choices visible throughout.
- **Disclosure:** Full, open transparency about tools used.

**Summary:**  
An AI-assisted work where the human creator retains authorship. Transparent, intentional, and culturally grounded.

---

### üß¨ Case 3: Remix Using AI-Generated Stems

**Description:**  
A remix producer creates a beat and uses AI-generated vocals imitating a famous voice. No permission is obtained, and no disclosure is made. The track is uploaded anonymously.

**Proposed Score:**  
**E/C/A/I/D = 7/3/2/5/0** ‚Üí Total: **34** ‚Üí ‚ö™ Silver

**Justification:**
- **Execution:** Technically smooth.
- **Cultural Sensitivity:** Ethically questionable voice mimicry.
- **Authenticity:** Borrowed voice, no personal authorship.
- **Intention:** Mostly stylistic, little expressive depth.
- **Disclosure:** None. Misleading to listener.

**Summary:**  
Polished but ethically risky. Use of synthetic voice without attribution or transparency erodes trust.

### üì° Case 4: Fully AI-Generated Background Music

**Description:**  
A production company uses a text-to-music tool to generate lo-fi ambient tracks for YouTube and meditation apps. No artist is credited. No mention of AI is made.

**Proposed Score:**  
**E/C/A/I/D = 6/5/0/2/0** ‚Üí Total: **26** ‚Üí ‚ö™ Silver

**Justification:**
- **Execution:** Passable, functional background music.
- **Cultural Sensitivity:** Style-appropriate, but impersonal.
- **Authenticity:** No creative authorship; all generated.
- **Intention:** Functional, not expressive.
- **Disclosure:** None; consumer unaware of AI origin.

**Summary:**  
A typical "invisible AI" case‚Äîundisclosed, uncredited, unexpressive. Not harmful in isolation, but lacks ethical grounding.

### üí° Coming Soon: More Examples

- Co-writing with AI lyric tools
- Generating stems, mixing by hand
- AI-generated visuals for music videos
- DJ sets made from AI tracks
- Sync licensing scenarios


## Positioning ECAID Among Related Frameworks

This commentary provides context for the role of the ECAID framework within the broader ecosystem of tools, standards, and ethical models addressing the use of artificial intelligence in creative work. It is intended to clarify the scope, intent, and boundaries of ECAID in relation to other relevant frameworks.

---

## 1. Purpose of ECAID

ECAID (Ethical Creator Authorship and Intent Disclosure) is a descriptive framework. It does not attempt to certify training data, enforce licensing, or cryptographically track content provenance. Instead, it provides an interpretive profile of a completed creative work, focused on authorship, intent, cultural sensitivity, and disclosure.

ECAID is not a legal standard, licensing system, or attribution mechanism. It is an ethical schema‚Äîintended to be used in parallel with existing technical and legal frameworks.

---

## 2. Relation to Existing Frameworks

ECAID complements several frameworks that address adjacent but distinct concerns. Key differences are summarized below.

### 2.1 Creative Commons (CC)

- CC governs the *reuse* of creative content, not its *authorship or ethical construction*.
- ECAID is independent of licensing and applies equally to proprietary, open, and unlicensed works.
- ECAID can be applied to works under any CC license to communicate process transparency.

### 2.2 Fair Use

- Fair Use is a legal doctrine that permits certain unlicensed uses of copyrighted works.
- ECAID is not concerned with legal permission but with ethical authorship and transparency.
- A work may qualify as fair use while scoring low on ECAID due to lack of disclosure or authorship.

### 2.3 C2PA (Content Provenance and Authenticity)

- C2PA embeds technical provenance and manipulation data at the file level.
- ECAID captures *interpretive authorship context*‚Äînot file metadata.
- C2PA can be used alongside ECAID to strengthen traceability and disclosure.

### 2.4 Fairly Trained and Model Cards

- These frameworks address the *inputs* to generative AI models (e.g., training data sourcing and licensing).
- ECAID addresses the *outputs* and how creators present those outputs to the public.
- ECAID assumes creators may not have full insight into model training data and therefore focuses on disclosure and intent.

---

## 3. ECAID‚Äôs Assumptions and Limitations

ECAID is grounded in the following assumptions:
- AI-assisted creation is an established, ongoing reality.
- Listeners, viewers, and collaborators are entitled to contextual information.
- Disclosure, authorship, and cultural care remain ethically relevant, even when traditional boundaries are blurred.

ECAID does not:
- Verify source data or detect deepfakes.
- Certify compliance with licensing or legal norms.
- Function as a forensic or enforcement tool.

It instead provides:
- A structured vocabulary for creators to describe their relationship to a work.
- A public profile format (radar chart + score) that is accessible to non-specialist audiences.
- A way to build and signal ethical trust, independent of platform tagging or legal enforcement.

---

## 4. Practical Interoperability

ECAID is designed to work *in parallel with*:

| Framework | ECAID Complements by... |
|----------|-------------------------|
| **Creative Commons** | Describing the intent and authorship of works regardless of licensing model. |
| **C2PA** | Adding human-readable context to machine-readable provenance. |
| **Fairly Trained** | Communicating creator intent and disclosure when model data integrity is not self-evident. |
| **AI Use Tags (Platform-level)** | Offering nuance beyond binary ‚ÄúAI used‚Äù labels. |
| **Fair Use** | Helping clarify ethical stance even when legal reuse is permitted. |

---

## 5. Focus on the Present Work

ECAID is intentionally agnostic about the internal contents of a model. It does not presume access to model transparency, nor does it attempt to regulate toolchains or APIs.

Instead, it evaluates the **observable relationship** between a creator and a finished work‚Äîmeasured in terms of authorship, expressive control, cultural sensitivity, and willingness to disclose.

This emphasis allows ECAID to remain usable regardless of:
- Model type (open-source, proprietary, multimodal)
- Platform (DSP, gallery, publishing platform)
- Creative domain (music, video, text, image, performance)

---

## 6. Conclusion

ECAID fills a gap left by other frameworks. It does not compete with provenance, licensing, or compliance standards. It provides a flexible, human-readable, creator-facing way to express ethical authorship in the era of generative tools.

The ethical challenges of AI in the arts are not solely technical or legal. They are personal, cultural, and contextual.  
ECAID gives creators and curators a structure for navigating those realities‚Äîone work at a time.

---

### üìù Note on Use of AI in Documentation

This page includes contributions generated with the assistance of AI tools to help collect, structure, and present longstanding creative knowledge. All content has been reviewed and validated for consistency with the ECAID ethical disclosure standard.

---

- Assess the **transparency** of the creator‚Äôs intent
- Filter submissions based on **minimum disclosure or authorship standards**
- Signal ethical care without resorting to binary ‚ÄúAI or not‚Äù classifications

ECAID is not intended to be used for legal enforcement or IP verification. It is an interpretive signal‚Äînot a compliance mechanism.

---

### 6.2 Sample Use Cases for Curators

| Context | Example Use of ECAID |
|--------|-----------------------|
| **Playlist Selection** | Prioritize Gold-badged works with high A/I/D scores for ‚Äúemerging artist‚Äù playlists |
| **Festival Submissions** | Require minimum D (Disclosure) and A (Authenticity) scores for AI-assisted performance categories |
| **Sync Licensing** | Use ECAID to distinguish between expressive authorship vs. stock/generated filler |
| **Educational Publishing** | Filter for high C/I scores to encourage culturally respectful and pedagogically sound works |

---

### 6.3 Suggested Thresholds (Optional)

These thresholds are not mandatory but may be helpful in shaping policy:

- **Minimum Disclosure Standard:** D ‚â• 6
- **Gold Badge Requirement:** Use only self-disclosed works (Gold) in certain editorial categories
- **Authenticity Filter:** A ‚â• 5 to qualify as a ‚Äúcreator-led‚Äù work
- **Red Flag Zone:** Works with D ‚â§ 3 *and* A ‚â§ 3 may be flagged for manual review

Curators are encouraged to define their own thresholds based on context, risk tolerance, and platform values.

---

### 6.4 Recommended Display Options

When publicly displaying or filtering based on ECAID scores, platforms should:

- Use the full 5-axis radar chart when space allows
- Include the E/C/A/I/D shorthand (e.g., `7/6/9/10/5`)
- Indicate badge type visually:  
  üü° **Gold** = self-disclosed  
  ‚ö™ **Silver** = third-party estimated

Avoid using ECAID scores as absolute measures of quality. The system is intended for **interpretive and ethical signaling**, not rating artistic merit.

---

### 6.5 Curation Ethics and Fair Access

Curators should remain aware that:

- A high ECAID score does not equate to legal compliance or originality
- A low ECAID score does not imply malicious intent
- Creators working in marginalized or resource-limited settings may have less access to disclosure tools or standardized processes

Where possible, curators should offer appeal mechanisms or feedback for rejected submissions based on ECAID criteria, and use ECAID as a tool for inclusion‚Äînot exclusion.

---

### 6.6 Summary

ECAID enables curators and institutions to assess creative works with greater nuance than binary AI tags allow. When used transparently and proportionally, it can improve trust, transparency, and alignment between platforms and creators.

Curators are encouraged to adapt ECAID policies thoughtfully, publish thresholds when feasible, and treat the framework as a guide for cultural responsibility‚Äînot a gatekeeping weapon.

## 7. Governance and Change Management

This section defines the process by which the ECAID framework is maintained, updated, and evolved. It outlines roles, submission procedures, versioning conventions, and community participation guidelines to ensure the framework remains transparent, adaptable, and well-governed.

---

### 7.1 Stewardship

The ECAID framework is maintained by **@ The ECAID Project**, an independent initiative led by creators, curators, and technologists committed to ethical authorship in the age of generative tools.

All official releases, supporting materials, and documentation are published at [ecaid.org] (or equivalent).

---

### 7.2 Scope of Change

Changes to the framework are categorized as follows:

- **Clarifications** ‚Äì Wording, examples, or explanations that improve understanding without changing definitions
- **Adjustments** ‚Äì Updates to scoring language, guidelines, or visuals that preserve core structure
- **Extensions** ‚Äì Additions of new tools, templates, or sector-specific adaptations (e.g., visual arts, text-based media)
- **Revisions** ‚Äì Structural or semantic changes to the axis definitions or scoring system itself

All changes are subject to review before incorporation.

---

### 7.3 Change Proposal Process

Anyone may propose a change to the ECAID framework by submitting a written **Change Request (ECR)** to ecaid@yourdomain.com.

An ECR should include:

- Proposed change summary  
- Motivation and problem being solved  
- Type of change (clarification, adjustment, extension, revision)  
- Potential impact on existing users or scores  
- Example before/after use cases (if applicable)

ECRs will be reviewed in quarterly cycles by a volunteer advisory group.

---

### 7.4 Review and Voting

Each ECR is evaluated by the **ECAID Editorial Working Group**, composed of invited contributors with domain expertise in:

- Music and media production  
- AI and creative tools  
- Ethics and authorship studies  
- Platform policy and curation

Decisions are made by consensus. In cases of disagreement, a 2/3 majority vote determines acceptance. All accepted ECRs are recorded in the public **Change Log**.

---

### 7.5 Versioning Policy

ECAID uses semantic versioning in the format:

`ECAID vX.Y`

- **Major version (X):** Structural revisions to the five axes, scoring logic, or badge system  
- **Minor version (Y):** Clarifications, visual adjustments, or additional guidance documents

For example:  
`ECAID v1.0` ‚Üí Original release  
`ECAID v1.1` ‚Üí New use cases and curator guidelines  
`ECAID v2.0` ‚Üí Revised axis definitions or scoring model

All works scored under previous versions may retain that version label. Score migration is optional unless required by a partner platform.

---

### 7.6 Publication and Transparency

All official versions of ECAID are:

- Published under a Creative Commons license (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)
- Timestamped and archived in the official repository
- Annotated with change summaries and rationale
- Publicly available for reference, audit, and implementation

Proposed and accepted changes are tracked on the [ECAID GitHub](https://github.com/ecaid-framework) or equivalent platform.

---

### 7.7 Community Participation

@ The ECAID Project encourages responsible participation in framework development. Creators, curators, technologists, and researchers are invited to:

- Propose changes via ECR  
- Contribute feedback to open drafts  
- Assist in advisory working groups  
- Translate the standard for global accessibility  
- Pilot new scoring models in their own communities

---

### 7.8 Deprecation

Outdated guidance, tools, or axis language may be deprecated over time. Deprecated elements remain archived for transparency but are marked clearly as inactive.

Where possible, migration paths will be documented.

---

### 7.9 Summary

ECAID is intended to be stable but responsive. Governance ensures the framework can grow with the evolving landscape of AI-assisted creativity‚Äîwithout undermining its original ethical foundations.

The standard remains open, interpretable, and community-guided. All changes are versioned, reviewed, and recorded.

## 8. Versioning Protocol

All updates to the ECAID framework are tracked using a semantic versioning system of the form:

`ECAID vX.Y`

- **X = Major Version**  
  Indicates a significant structural revision to the framework, including changes to axis definitions, scoring logic, or badge classification. These changes may alter how existing works would be scored and require clear migration guidance.

- **Y = Minor Version**  
  Represents clarifications, visual refinements, new documentation, additional examples, or sector-specific adaptations. These changes do not affect the core scoring methodology or axis structure.

### 8.1 Example Version History

| Version | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `v1.0` | Initial release with full scoring system and visual standard |
| `v1.1` | Addition of curatorial guidelines, expanded use cases |
| `v1.2` | Commentary document and framework comparison |
| `v2.0` | Revised axis language or scoring scale (requires migration path) |

### 8.2 Version Display

All ECAID materials (including charts, profiles, and documentation) should clearly indicate the version under which they were created. Radar charts and badges may optionally include version metadata in tooltips, captions, or file tags.

When used in publication or archival contexts, the version must be retained for historical and comparative accuracy.

---

## 9. Community Involvement Plan

ECAID is intended to evolve with input from the broader creative ecosystem. While the framework is initially stewarded by @ The ECAID Project, its long-term relevance depends on participatory guidance and practical feedback from real-world use.
